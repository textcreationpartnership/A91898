            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to him. This part of his Works, ſpeaks him both learned and pious; not a Novice in the things of God, nor a Work-man that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be aſhamed; but a man of God, throughly furniſht to every good work. He was eminent for Prayer, in Meditation frequent, and in Temptation much experienced: One that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes valued his Peoples ſoules above his own life; And, like a Candle, he quickly ſpent himſelf, to give light to them. It was one of his Swan-like Expreſſions, (when on his Death-bed) that he loved Praying and Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dayes with all his heart: The which, he declared abundantly, in his Practice, whileſt he lived, being frequent therein, both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and private. As for the Subject here treated on, it's true, that there are many others that have written thereon; yet, we know, that the commoneſt Meats do yield the moſt wholeſome nouriſhment, whereas new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Diſhes do but clog the ſtomack, and fill the body with unwholeſome Humours. Beſides, if the ſound and new manner of handling common things, may commend them, (as it ever did, <gap reason="foreign">

At which, it may be, ſome may take diſtaſte: But I anſwer, It was intended for the Pulpit, not for the Preſs; where, <hi>Mores non verba compoſuit, &amp; animis dixit non auribus,</hi> The ſcope of his Labours was his Auditors Inſtruction, not his own applauſe: nor did he care ſo much to pleaſe, as to profit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 19.

Like an able and skilfull Phyſitian, he doth firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowel the Diſeaſe, and then applies his heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Medicines. Like an experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, he firſt diſcovers the ſtratagems of this old and ſubtil Adverſary, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs thee how to wave them. Like a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pilot, he fore-ſees the many Shelvs and

Rocks, on, or againſt which, the Pirat labours to gravel or ſplit the ſhip of thy Soul; and then ſets up his Land-marks, whereby thou mayſt avoid them. Bleſs God for theſe Helps, and learn from them to fight the good fight of Faith, till thou have finiſhed thy courſe, and obtained thy Crown. It behoveth thee now (if ever) to ſtand upon thy guard, thy Enemy being heated with rage, becauſe he knows his time is ſhort: yet deſpond not, for the God of Peace will ſhortly tread him under thy feet. <hi>Sceva,</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Dyrrcahium,</hi> reſiſted <hi>Pompey's</hi> Army ſo long alone, that he had two hundred and twenty Darts ſticking in his Shield, and loſt one of his eyes; and yet he gave not over, till <hi>Caeſar</hi> came to his reſcue.

In which we have theſe three parts:</p>

               <p>The Verſes which I have read are the firſt part of the Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſhort and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious Tractate about the Spiritual Armor: concerning which, the Apoſtle doth two things:</p>

               <p>We are firſt to begin with the general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, as it is laid down in the 13 <hi>verſe: Wherefore, take unto you the whole Armour,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle had given this counſel, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and yet becauſe it was a very neceſſary Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, he doth here repeat it in <hi>Terminis:</hi> From whence, before we come to the particulars, we ſhall lay down this Doctrine in generall, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>And this is neceſſary, if we conſider theſe three things; 1. The Incapacity of mens minds to underſtand the things of God. The Scripture tels us, that the mind of man is full of darkneſs and blindneſs, <hi>vid. Eph.</hi> 4. 18. The Apoſtle, in that place, deſcribes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man, by Nature; telling, that there is a thick skin, a vail of blindneſs covering their hearts; and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 4. That <hi>the God of this world hath blinded their eyes.</hi> They are <hi>blind</hi> by Nature, and they are <hi>blinded</hi> by Satan: 'Tis true, God gave man a ſeeing-eye, when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170109:7"/>
he made him at firſt. <hi>Adam</hi> knew the Nature of every Creature, and gave them apt Names, anſwerable to their Nature, and he knew his God, &amp;c. but by the Fall, the eye of the Soul is become darkned, as to ſpiritual things &amp; very dim as to other things: Man by affecting a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden knowledge, fell into groſs ignorance: he would needs know as much as a God, &amp; he became as ignorant as a Beaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 20. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 16. There is <hi>Ignorantia purae negatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 5.</note> which is no ſinne: Chriſt knew not the Day of Judgment; the Tradeſ-man knows not Aſtrology: and there is <hi>Ignorantia pravae diſpoſitionis,</hi> when a man will be ſo, and affects it &amp;c. This is in man by Nature. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the pure naturall man doth not underſtand the things of the Spirit, nor can he, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. They may, and many of them do, underſtand the matters of God <hi>Hiſtorically</hi> and <hi>Notionally;</hi> but <hi>Spiritually,</hi> &amp; <hi>Savingly,</hi> and <hi>applicatorily,</hi> and <hi>transformingly</hi> they cannot. And as for the people of God, who are inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by Grace, yet even they labour under much ignorance ſtill. We find, that even the Diſciples of Chriſt, though they had been tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor'd by him who was wiſer then <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet they were often at a loſs, to underſtand tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e things which were not very obſcure, <hi>vid. Mat.</hi> 15. 16, 17, 18. And though Chriſt had often told them of his Paſſion, &amp;c. yet we find they were very much to ſeek in that very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170109:8"/>
after the death of their Maſter, <hi>vid. Luke</hi> 24. 25, 26. This makes theſe repetitions very neceſſary. If Man were as at firſt, a very hint or glympſe, would be enough: but in regard of his dulneſs, there is need of theſe Rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals; And know this, that it is an Act of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in God, to the blindneſs of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rure, to repeat the ſame things more then once. It's ſaid of Chriſt, that he can have compaſsion on the Ignorant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 2. Theſe Rehearſals are one clear Teſtimony, amongſt many others, of his compaſſion to ignorant ſinners. 2. The Imbecillity and weakneſs of the memory. The Memory is the Treaſury and Store-houſe of the Soul; the peculiar Office of the memory, is to retain and keep carefully all the Notions which are apprehended and taken in by the Underſtanding, and all the Species which are drawn from ſeveral Objects by the externall and internal Senſes. 'Tis the Regiſtry of the Soul, where theſe things ſhould be faithfully recorded, and kept for after-time. Now there is a very great imperfection in this Regiſter: This weakneſs ariſeth; 1. from that Naturall Diſtemper which is in it by reaſon of ſin: The Fall of Man did ſo bruiſe and crack this golden Veſſel, that it doth leak ever ſince, and cannot hold that which is put into it. The Apoſtle in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 1. ſpeakes of this Diſtemper, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The memory is like a Veſſel which is rent and full of holes. Thoſe golden
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170109:8"/>
Hoopes, which God in the firſt Creation, did ſet about this Veſſel, are either quite broken off, or much looſened. And then there are, ſecondly, alſo other things, which make it ſo lubrick and crazy, as to the retaining of things Spiritual and Divine, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it's over-charged with too many <note place="margin">Three Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a weak Memory.</note> worldly and ſinful things: the world is ſo much laid up in this Treaſury, that there is very little room for Heavenly things to be ſtowed there.</p>
               <p>Secondly, want of Meditation and recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection: by this means it comes to paſs, that many Truths which are recorded in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, are as if they had never been ſet down, in regard of uſe and improvement; becauſe by meditation and diſcourſe they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived. There is an Act of the Memory pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per unto man, which the Philoſopher calls <note place="margin">Euſtach Phyſ. p. 261.</note> 
                  <hi>Reminiſcentia,</hi> when a thing which hath been recorded, and is forgotten, is, by the help of Diſcourſe, and Reaſoning, recovered again, and made preſent: and without this, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to keep alive the remembrance of many things. Now it's a very general fault, not onely amongſt wicked men, but even amongſt the people of God, that they neglect this Duty of Diſcourſe and Meditation: they do not chew the Cud, as they are required; and ſo quite loſe many things which they have heard, underſtood, and ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. <hi>Iſaac</hi> went into the fields to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate,
<pb facs="tcp:170109:9"/>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. <hi>David</hi> uſed to meditate on Gods Statutes, as well as to read and hear them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 15.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Devil he pilfers out many Truths: he comes with his falſe Key, and picks the Lock of the Memory, and ſo the ſoul is bereaved of many a precious Truth, <hi>vid. Mat.</hi> 13. 19. He comes, and ſearcheth the books, and whatever he finds there, that may be prejudicial to his Kingdom, he either quite takes it off the File, or elſe ſo blurs it with his black Lines, that in a very ſhort time the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord becomes altogether uſeleſs. Therefore, for the ſtrengthning of the weak Memory, it's not without need, that things of moment and concernment ſhould be inculcated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated. 3. in regard of the Will; and that 1. from the deadneſs, and ſlowneſs, and unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of the Will and Affections to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and give entertainment to ſaving truths, at firſt, when offered. The heart of man is like hard Marble, harder then any Adamant, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 12. Impreſſions are not made upon it with one blow: the Iron is not heated through, with once putting into the fire: there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy and contradiction in the Will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the receiving of things of this Nature. <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked, and uncircumciſed in heart, ye have alwayes reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 7. 51. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of many Remora's and Obſtructions in the heart, which hinder the effectual working of the Word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170109:9"/>
Strong holds, carnall reaſonings, things exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves againſt the knowledge of God, and high thoughts, &amp;c. The ſoul is full of ſurmiſings, prejudices, objections, and ſtrong oppoſings: the ſtrong man armed keeps the houſe, and by force of Arms contends againſt divine Truths, eſpecially ſuch as are of weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt concernment, And therfore there is need of urging and preſſing the ſame things over and over, and that with earneſtneſs, that theſe high Towers may be levelled.</p>
               <p>And then (2.) After that the heart hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and yielded, it doth in a very ſhort time through the prevalency of indwelling corruption, revolt and grow ſtiffe again, and is very backward to practiſe Truths ſubjected unto: It was the ſad complaint of one of the Ancients, that of all Trades and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note> that of the Miniſtry is moſt difficult, as in other reſpects, ſo in this, that he can never finde his work as he leaves it. Let a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Maſon, or any other Craftſ-man, ſhape and ſquare, and poliſh his work, and when he returns he findes it ſo; but the Devil he mars a Miniſters work, as ſoone as ever he hath done. When he hath digged a well of godly ſorrow, this Philiſtine comes and ſtops it up preſently. When he hath ſtubd up the thorns, the Devill comes and plants them again, or more in their room. When he hath caſt down the Wall; in one week, yea in one night, he findes it ſet up again, &amp;c. Every obſerving,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170109:10"/>
and ſelfe-ſearching Chriſtian, knowes the truth of this by ſad experience. When any holy Reſolution hath been with much labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring begot in the heart, Satan and his own corruption working together, do ſoon cool &amp; check: the form he brought with him, from hearing the word, is ſoon unfaſhioned again.</p>
               <p>Oh <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thy goodneſs is as the Morning dew, and as the early Cloud, it preſently va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth away. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 4. Commands are not eaſily obeyed, therefore there muſt be precept upon precept. The conſolations of the Goſpel are not eaſily preſerved: therefore there muſt be promiſe upon promiſe. Its a hard thing to go on in duty conſtantly, the heart will back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlide: Its a hard thing to keep it light, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and cloſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> had left her firſt love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. 5. <hi>Ephraim</hi> was a back-ſliding hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 16. they were revolted and gone. Thy people, ſaith God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> have ſoon corrupted themſelves, &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 7. 8. <hi>Paul</hi> had faithfully preached the Doctrine of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith, to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> when he was perſonally with them; but in a very ſhort time, they were apoſtatized by the fraudulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and craftineſs of falſe Teachers: therefore he is forced to write to them the ſame things again, <hi>vid. Gal.</hi> 1. 6. We ſee the Diſciples of Chriſt, though they were commanded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by their Maſter to watch with him, when he was in his Agony, ready to die for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170109:10"/>
them; yet as ſoon as he was departed, they fell aſleep again; and though he came and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them, yet they fell aſleep again, <hi>vid. Matth.</hi> 26. 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45. A man would wonder, that when Chriſt had told them, that the pangs of death were upon him, yet they ſhould fall aſleep, &amp;c. We have a diſcovery, in them, of the hearts Apoſtacy. <note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This ſhould be a Directory for the Miniſters of the Goſpel: That they would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented onely once to name neceſſary truths, but to be ever and anon (as they obſerve the ſlackneſs and negligence of people, in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing) preſſing, and urging the ſame again, and again. There are ſome Doctrines which are as ſtanding Diſhes, as the Doctrine of faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, &amp;c. theſe are of neceſſary and daily uſe; and people muſt be oft put in minde of them. There are ſome ſins which are predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in every Age: theſe the Miniſters of Chriſt muſt be often beating down and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: There are ſome duties to which men are very averſe, theſe muſt be often urged. Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie was a raigning ſin amongſt the Jews, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour at every turn was beating down that ſin. Apoſtacy from the truth of the Goſpel, by hearkening to ſeducers, was the great ſin of the Churches of the Goſpel: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the Apoſtles, who writ to thoſe Churches, did urge and preſs a care about that more then once or twice, &amp;c. Onely the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God muſt be carefull of theſe three things, in reference to this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:170109:11"/>
1. That they do it not becauſe of ſluggiſhnes or ſloathfulneſs of ſpirit: Idleneſs is a very great ſin in any Calling, much more in the Miniſtry, their Calling being of greater importance then any other. If the Lord of the Vineyard come and finde them ſleeping, and ſnorting, by reaſon of negligence, he will cut them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder, and give them their portion with the Hypocrites, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 48, 49, 50, 51. God hath given them a large taske, they have a broad field to walk in, they are to preach the whole Counſel of God, and therefore they muſt not inſiſt upon the ſame things, out of a ſpirit of lazineſs, but meerly out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to, and compaſſion of, the neceſſity of the people. And then, 2. That they be as careful in ſtudying the ſame Doctrines, as if they had never made any mention of them before; That if it fall into their way to ſpeak about the ſame Duty, or about the ſame ſin, concerning w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they have formerly ſpoken, they may have freſh Arguments, to recommend the ſame du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and freſh conſiderations, to manifeſt and make evident, the vileneſs of the ſame ſin, &amp;c. They muſt ſtill dive further into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and meditate more earneſtly, that they may ſpeak more convincingly then before, to the Conſciences of ſuch as hear them.</p>
               <p>3. That they ſeek earneſtly to God by prayer, in the behalf of the people, that their hearts may ſo readily practiſe the Duty enjoyned &amp; avoid the ſin reproved, that they may have no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170109:11"/>
further occaſion to remember them any more of the ſame things.</p>
               <p>Let the people of God be willing, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity <note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> requires, to hear of the ſame duty, and of the ſame ſinne, over and over. Many men cannot endure to hear of a Duty twice, though they can be content to omit it when the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter hath done all he is able; nor are they patient to hear the ſame ſin twice reproved, though they can be content to commit it an hundred times over, it may be, in one week. It is no advantage to the Miniſter; but it's a great benefit to you. <hi>It's ſafe for you, Phil.</hi> 3. 1. It's an Argument of love and care, in the Miniſters of God, over your ſouls. They are afraid you ſhould miſs the way to Heaven; and therefore they give you your direction over again. They are afraid the Sore ſhould not be well healed; and therefore they apply another Plaiſter to it, that the Cure may be perfect. They would preſent every man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 28. therefore they incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate things.</p>
               <p>If you would hear no more of the ſame Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do you practiſe it carefully: If you would not hear of the ſame ſin again, ceaſe from it; break it off by repentance, and then you ſhall hear no more of it. And indeed, this is one great uſe which all Chriſtians ſhould make of theſe Repetitions. 1. To be convinced of the badneſs of their own hearts: And 2. to learn more diligently to practiſe what is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170109:12"/>
commended; and to avoid what is ſo often forbidden. Otherwiſe, know this, that ſuch Rehearſals will be very ſad Aggravations of ſin another day. When Conſcience ſhall bring in teſtimony, that ſuch a Duty was preached over and over, and yet you would never practiſe it; ſuch a ſinne was forbidden you many a time, yet you would not leave it. You heard it preſſed upon you (more then perhaps a hundred times) that you ſhould believe, repent, pray in your Families, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct your Children, and read the Scriptures; &amp;c. but you could never get up your hearts to the Duty. You heard more then once, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a thouſand times, that you ſhould not ſwear, nor lie, nor abuſe the Creatures to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, nor break the Sabbath, &amp;c. yet you would go on, &amp;c. Theſe often Repeatings of your duties will be high aggravations, and ſo many Witneſſes of your contempt. And indeed, this is one End why they are uſed in the Scriptures, and commanded to be uſed in the Miniſtry, <hi>That thoſe that do not obey, after all theſe inculcations; may be left without excuſe, and condemned by ſo many Witneſſes.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle uſeth ſuch an Argument as this to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. This is the third time I am <note place="margin">He alludes to the Law, Deut. 17. 3.</note> coming to you; At the mouth of 2 or 3 Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſhall every word be eſtabliſhed.

of their ſin; and if they did not repent before his coming, this three-fold Warning would be as a three-fold Teſtimony, to prove them incorrigible; So will all the Repeatings of the ſame Duties, both in the Scripture, and in the mouth of Gods Miniſters, be in ſtead of ſo many clear Teſtimonies of your incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, when Chriſt comes to judge and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the diſobedience of the World: And look how often your Admonitions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes have been repeated; ſo often ſhall the ſtripes of Gods hand be repeated alſo.

               <p>We find in the Goſpel, that our Saviour makes this a ſharp and clear conviction of the Jews ſtubborneſs, that they would not ſubmit to his yoke, and be brought into obedience, though they were often required, and urged thereunto. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, &amp;c. how often would I have gathered thy Children together, as the Hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not, Lukc</hi> 13. 34. <hi>behold your houſe is leſt unto you deſolate.</hi> It's damnable to refuſe any Duty, though but once commanded; and to run into any act of ſinne, though but once forbidden; but not to hearken, after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Admonitions, will be a proof of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs by a thouſand Witneſſes. And the torment of the Conſcience in Hell will

               </p>
               <p>This is neceſſarily implyed in the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it were ſuperfluous, and unneceſſary counſell to adviſe chriſtians to get this furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if they were not certaine to have a day of battell.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170109:14"/>

III Why God ſuffers his people to be thus aſſaulted.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">I. Any day, in which God permits Satan and gives him liberty, may become an evill day: temptation will turn the brighteſt and moſt comfortable day into an evill and bitter day. Though he be continually aſſaulting 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 8. yet there are ſome ſpeciall dayes and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in which Satan doth more fiercely aſſault and ſet upon the ſoul. I ſhall name a few. <hi>viz.</hi> theſe 8 enſuing particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The time of outward perſonall calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and affliction; when God ſhall by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence bring a believer under outward cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and trouble of any ſort, ſickneſſe, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, or impriſonment, or baniſhment this is a ſpeciall day for Satan to aſſault in. Thus we ſee it in the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> when God had taken away his goods, and ſtricken him in his Children, and laid his hand upon his body in a violent manner, then Satan he brings his forces to aſſault his ſoul and minde with temptations, <hi>vid. Job.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>As ſuch a time Satan aſſaults the ſoul with theſe two temptations.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To murmur and to blaſpheme God, <hi>vid. Job.</hi> 2. 9. His endeavour is to perſwade the afflicted ſoul into an ill opinion of his God; that God doth not love them, if he did he would not ſo diſtreſſe them. He did prevaile with <hi>Job</hi> in this evill day, to curſe the day of his birth, <hi>Job.</hi> 3. <hi>init.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:170109:15"/>
(2) To uſe ſome ſinfull in direct meanes to be delivered out of ſuch troubles. This way he aſſaulted <hi>David</hi> in the evill day: he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to fly out of the land of <hi>Judea</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Philiſtims, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1. 2. And in this evill day he aſſaulted our Saviour with the like temptation, If thou be the Son of God, command theſe ſtones to be made bread, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 3. It was an unlawfull meanes to work a miracle at the direction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Satan. Thus was <hi>Nehemiah</hi> aſſaulted <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 10. which was (doubtleſſe) from Satan though not immediatly, but by the hand of a pretended friend. Thus he tempted <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to equivocate and deny his wife in a day of outward trouble, <hi>vid. Gen.</hi> 12, 11. 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The day of Church-calamity, eſpecially when cruell Heretiques and cunning Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are riſen up. This is one ſpeciall time of Satans aſſaulting ſuch as are truely godly. And indeed this is, I ſuppoſe, the evil day of which the Apoſtles ſpeaks more particularly in this place. We read <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 29, 30. that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle taking his laſt leave of this Church of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus, doth by the Spirit of prophecy give them to underſtand in his farewell Sermon That when he was gon away, there ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in grievous wolves, which ſhould not ſpare the flock; and that there ſhould ariſe ſeducers from amongſt themſelves which ſhould preach <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>preſerve things</hi> to draw away diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:170109:16"/>
And now writing to this very Church he doth put them in mind of this evill day, <hi>Zanchy</hi> in his Commentaries upon this Text gives us this Interpretation, making this day to be meant eſpecially of that time when God permits Satan <hi>quaſi ſolutum graſſari, et Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiamturbari per tyrannos, per haereticos tam oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultos &amp; hppocritas, quàm manifeſtos.</hi> And indeed as this day is an evill day, ſo it is a fit day for Satan to aſſault and make his Onſet. In ſuch a Day.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) He doth endevour to prevaile with chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to doubt of the truth which they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved &amp; embraced, and many times to caſt it off, and to run after fables. You ſhall find that in ſuch a day as this, Satan hath carried many captive by this temptation, <hi>vid. Gal.</hi> 1. 6. In this evill day, there was a great Apoſtacy from the faith of the Goſpel. And 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4. we have a prophecy of the defection which ſhould be made in ſuch times, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) He tempts many in ſuch a day to revile &amp; ſpeak evill of the truth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. Satan is, no doubt, very buſie at ſuch a time, both by feare of perſecution, and by promiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and by hopes of ſinfull liberty to draw off men from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel to embrace his deluſions. We find in our own Church by the lukewarmneſſe of moſt, and the defection of many, that ſuch a day is a great aſſaulting day.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:170109:16"/>
3 The day of ſinfull miſcarriage: When a child of God ſlips through infirmity and frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into ſome enormity, this is a ſpeciall day of temptation to the ſoul. Satan makes many onſets in ſuch a day, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) He aſſaults the ſoul by temptations to Conceale and hide the ſin commited: thus he aſſaulted <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 32. 3. Satan that drew him into the ſin aſſaulted and tempted him afterward not to confeſſe his ſin. And <hi>David</hi> lay a long time in that ſnare, till God ſent <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> to ſet conſcience a ſpeaking.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) He tempts the ſoul to Excuſe the ſin, at leaſt in part. Thus he aſſaulted our firſt parents, firſt he drew them into ſin, &amp; then tempts them to make excuſe, The Serpent ſaith the woman beguiled me, and I did eat, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 13. And ſaith the man, The woman which thou gav'ſt me ſhe gave me of the tree &amp; I did eat, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 12 And thus was <hi>Aaron</hi> aſſaulted by Satan when he had ſinned, <hi>vid. Exod.</hi> 32. 22. 23. 24. We may ſee how irrationall his anſwer is: he would have excuſed his ſin, and he doth indeed, by all he ſaith, aggravate his ſin.</p>
               <p>Thus he tempted <hi>Abraham</hi> to make an excuſe for his lying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>She is the daughter of my Father, but not the daughter of my Mother,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) He tempts them in ſuch a day to call in queſtion their Converſion &amp; Regeneration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſin. <hi>David</hi> ſeems to be under this temptation, when he had fallen into the ſins
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170109:17"/>
of murther and adultery, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 51. 10. <hi>Create in me a cleane heart, ô God, and renew a right ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within me.</hi> He was tempted to believe that ſuch ſins were inconſiſtent with conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, therefore he calls for a new Creation. 4. He tempts the ſoul to deſpaire of remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and pardon, and reconciliation with God. Under this tempation was the Church, in <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 42, They prayed and had not preſent ſenſe of forgiveneſſe, therefore they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to queſtion whether God had or would forgive their ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The day of ſpirituall deſertion, when God for ſin hides the light of his countenance from the ſoul: Such a day is a peculiar day of temptation; Satan will rage with violence at ſuch a time.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) He will perſwade the ſoul that God hath utterly caſt him off. Thus it was with <hi>Jonah, Cap.</hi> 2. 4. And under this temptation was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaph</hi> in ſuch a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77, 7, 8. 9. Wil the Lord caſt off for ever? will he be favourable no more? Is his mercy gon for ever? hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger ſhut up his tender mercies? And ſo it was with <hi>Heman, Pſal.</hi> 88. 14. Lord, why caſteſt thou off my ſoul, why hideſt thou thy face from me?</p>
               <p n="2">(2) He perſwades the ſoul at ſuch a time to caſt off God and to caſt off duty, and to leave waiting upon God. He perſwades the ſoul that all religion is in vaine and to no purpoſe, that he doth but diſhonour God in making mention of his name, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:170109:17"/>
5. The day of extraordinary Enlargement and inward manifeſtations of God. When the ſoul hath had more then ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, then Satan uſually tempts.</p>
               <p>And in ſuch a day he aſſaults the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Which ſpiritual ſecurity, <hi>vid. Cant.</hi> 5. 1, 2. In the former verſe we ſee Chriſt and the Church feaſting together. Jeſus Chriſt had ſhewed her more then ordinary favour; now Satan takes occaſion of tempting the ſoul; and the next news you heare, ſhe is ſung into a ſpirituall ſlumber. I ſleepe but my heart waketh.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) With ſpirituall pride, Satan then ſets the ſoul upon applauding it ſelfe, as if for ſome worth in it ſelf, it had enjoyed ſuch great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.

And the Temptation of ſuch an evill day is, To ſwell up the heart with pride and vain glory: ſo it was with <hi>David.</hi> Satan tempted him to number the people.

This Satan knowes, is the laſt ſtorm that ever he ſhall make upon the ſoul; if he conquer not now, he ſhall never conquer: therefore he uſeth all the power, and all the policy he hath to carry captive the ſoul at this laſt encounter. We ſee by daily experience, that Satan ſhoots his Arrows at the Saints on this day. There are very few that go out of the World, without ſtrong and many Onſets of Satan.</p>

There never was, never ſhall, any of the true Servants of God be loſt, or utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in this day: my Father is ſtronger then all, and no man ſhall pluck them out of my Fathers hands, <hi>John</hi> 10. 29.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170109:19"/>
Temptation. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31. Satan muſt prevail againſt Chriſt, before he can prevail againſt any of Chriſts. That which was the bleſſing of <hi>Gad,</hi> is the bleſſing of every true Iſraelite. A troop ſhall overcome him, but he ſhall overcome him at the laſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10. <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels fought with the Dragon, and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon fought, and his Angels; but they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed not, nor ſhall they ever prevail, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 8. So that in regard of the finall iſſue, it is ſo far from being an evill day, that it is indeed a good day.</p>
               <p>But it may be called an evill day, in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of Satans Intention,</hi> he aims at nothing but evill, he means to ſwallow up, to ruine, to devoure, and to lead the ſoul captive for ever, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. We may ſay of the Devil, in all his aſſaults, as God ſaith of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> whom God uſed, to chaſtiſe his Church, <hi>Iſay</hi> 10. 7, 8, 9, 10. God put his people under his power onely for correction; but he aimed at their deſtruction. Howbeit, he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſo, neither doth his heart think ſo, but it is in his heart to deſtroy, and to cut off Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not a few, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In regard of preſent effects and Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> It creates many fears, much ſadnes, many doubtings unto a Child of God, that is in ſuch a condition: Therefore an evill day.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>Temptation bereaves the ſoul of preſent comfort, and fills it full of horrors and tremblings.</hi>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:170109:19"/>
If you read over the 88. Pſalm, you may ſee how it was with <hi>Heman,</hi> in the day of his Temptation. My ſoul is full of troubles, my life draweth nigh unto the grave, v. 2. Thou haſt laid me in the loweſt pit, in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the deeps, while I ſuffer thy terrors, I am diſtracted, v. 15.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Temptation hinders the ſoul from doing that good, and receiving that good, it might do and receive, at another time.</hi> It hinders from praying, from hearing, from meditation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(3.) <hi>It doth many times involve the ſoul in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſins:</hi> it cauſeth ſometimes diſtruſt, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time creates prejudice in the ſoul againſt God, and godlineſs, and ſometimes evill ſpeakings, ſometimes neglects of duty. Thoſe who are hampered under ſuch Aſſaults, finde and can diſcover the evill of it, better then we can ſpeak or conceive.</p>
               <p>III. Why doth God ſuffer his people to be thus aſſaulted and tempted? Why doth he permit ſuch dayes to come upon them?</p>
               <p>1. <hi>In regard of himſelf.</hi> That he may ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his Power, and Providence, and wiſdom, and Grace, and faithfulneſs to his people, both in ſupporting, and in delivering them out of Temptation. Theſe Attributes of God are moſt clearly diſcovered in ſuch a day. My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Paul</hi> never apprehended ſo much of the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of Gods grace, or power, &amp;c. as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170109:20"/>
he did when he was under the buffettings of Satan. Now he underſtood what Almighty Power was, and what Providence was, and what Faithfulneſs was, and what infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom meant, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>II. In regard of his people. 1. <hi>To teach them to hate ſin, and to watch againſt it.</hi> The ſoul that hath been much under theſe Aſſaults, will not be ſo bold as others are: the ſmoke of ſin, the very ſight of it, will be offenſive to his eyes.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>To teach him how to handle and uſe his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Armor.</hi> Chriſtian Graces are beſt uſed, and moſt improved in a day of Temptation. Now he knowes how to uſe faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and hope, and ſeeth what ſtrength is in them; he knowes now the power of faith, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 11. Now he ſeeth the efficacy of Hope, and the potency of Prayer: he now ſeeth the excellency of all his graces, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and uſefulneſs of them, that which he knew before in the Notion; he now knowes by Experience, And then</p>
               <p>3. <hi>To make them more experimentally feele the love of Chriſt, in ſubmitting Himſelf to Temptations for their ſakes.</hi> The tempted ſoul knowes beſt the ſorrow of Chriſts Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and the greatneſs of his Affection in being willing to be tempted for their ſakes. As Chriſt would actually be tempted, that he might experimentally ſuccour them that are tempted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2: 18. ſo he will have his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170109:20"/>
people tempted, that they may the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally know how to prize His Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>4. To kill their ſins, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. The bran is ſifted out onely.</p>
               <p>III. In regard of Satan. 1. <hi>God will have him do ſome ſervice for Himſelf, and ſome ſervice al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for His people.</hi> All the Temptations of Satan are indeed acts of Service, which the Devill doth for God and his Church. Satan did God ſervice, and <hi>Paul</hi> too, in buffetting of him, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. compared with 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is but Gods Servant, and his peoples Drudge, in doing this work for them. He is your Scullion, by his Temptations to rub you bright, &amp;c. As the good Angels are miniſtring ſpirits, employed for the good of them that are Heirs of ſalvation, <hi>Heb:</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> ſo are the wicked Angels too; though in tempting, they neither aim at Gods honour, nor your good.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Tis for the increaſing of his Torment.</hi> This is done two wayes. 1. <hi>It adds torment to him, to ſee himſelfe baffeled and diſappointed in his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults.</hi> He alwayes comes off foyled at laſt, when he meddles with any of Gods Servants. How did <hi>Job</hi> baffle this roaring Lyon? <hi>Job</hi> got and kept the field, and the Devill with all his Troops were utterly routed.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>All his Temptations and Aſſaults, ſhall add to his Eternall torment, when he comes to have his laſt finall Doom.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170109:21"/>
the Angels that ſinned are delivered into chains of darkneſs, and reſerved unto judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. And all the miſchief he doth now in the world will be laid to his charge at that Day. Satan doth but blow his own fire, and heat his own Hell, and dig that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit deeper, by his malice and rage, in aſſaulting the godly: So much the more wrath will be powred upon him, for the killing of <hi>Job's</hi> Children, and the deſtroying of his goods, and the tempting of him in his ſoul. Then ſhall <hi>Pauls</hi> buffettings, and <hi>Davids</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyings, be returned with fury upon his own head.</p>
               <p>Let all Chriſtians take heed of paſſing any <note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> raſh ſentence, either againſt themſelves, or againſt any others, that they are not the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, becauſe of Satans aſſaults. It is the great deſign that Satan drives on: by the aſſaulting of the ſervants of God, to make them queſtion their Election and Intereſt in God, that ſo he may take off their hearts from cheerfulneſs in his ſervice; as is evident in the caſe of <hi>Job.</hi> And he doth too much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon many by this means, who through incogitancy and unbelief, are ready to blot their names out of Gods book, becauſe of ſuch Conflicts. If God took any delight in me, he would not ſuffer the Adverſary thus to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault me? I cannot either pray or hear, ſleep or wake, but Satan afflicts me; God hath made me the Mark of Satan, at which he ſhoots his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170109:21"/>
Arrows continually. This Doctrine may be a Cordial for ſuch Chriſtians: Thy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be made uncomfortable, by reaſon of Temptations; but all that Satan doth, or can do, is not able to make thy condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe. <hi>Job</hi> was <hi>Job</hi> ſtill, even when Satan ſhot at him; <hi>Peter</hi> was the beloved Diſciple of Chriſt, though he was ſifted by Temptations. <hi>Paul</hi> was a choſen Veſſel ſtill, though the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of Satan did ſore buffet him. Yea, to put all out of doubt, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf was as ſorely aſſaulted, as thou canſt be, and yet the Elect of God, in whom his ſoul delighted, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 42. 1. Read but the fourth Chapter of <hi>Matth. ver.</hi> 1, 2. and 11. and do but conſider that Story well, and it will prevent thee from being diſcouraged in the day of thy Conflict. 1. God permits Satan there to appear in a bodily ſhape to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. This is more then God hath given him leave to do againſt thee. If it were thus with thee; yet thou ſhouldſt not conclude any thing againſt thy ſelf. 2. God permitted him to have power to carry and tranſport the body of Chriſt from place to place, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 8. He had liberty given him to tranſport the body of Chriſt, firſt from the Wilderneſs, to the City; and from the City, to the Pinacle of the Temple. This hath not yet befallen thee; If it had, there would be no cauſe to conclude thy ſelf caſt off by God. And if you look upon the Nature of the Temptations of Chriſt, you will then find a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170109:22"/>
three-fold Onſet, and a three-fold Repulſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Temptation is, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4. There he tempts him. 1. To queſtion his Son-ſhip, <hi>If thou be the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c. 2. He tempts him to queſtion the Care and Providence of God over him, that he ſuffered him to be hungry, and to want bread. Surely, his Care was not great that had not provided any thing for him, after ſo long faſting. And then, 3. He tempts him to uſe indirect means, for preſent ſupply, to work a Miracle at his Command; <hi>Command that theſe ſtones be made bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2d. Temptation is, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6, 7. There Satan tempts him to take away his life: <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down,</hi> &amp;c. And he brings Scipture to ſet on this Temptation, though he wreſted the meaning of it: It's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Satan may tempt a dear Child of God, to lay violent hands upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>3d. Temptation is, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. He tempts him there to Idolatry, Blaſphemy; to deny the true God, and to worſhip him as his God. <hi>All theſe will I give thee,</hi> &amp;c. Let this Scripture be well ſtudied, and it will preſerve you from concluding your ſelves Reprobates, becauſe of Temptations; eſpecially conſidering this, that one Reaſon why Chriſt would ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be aſſaulted, was, that his Temptations might be as a ſtaff to uphold his ſervants in all Ages, from being over-much diſcouraged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Temptations.</p>
               <p>And then further, God doth put honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people, by ſuffering them to be aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170109:22"/>
God did much honour <hi>Job,</hi> by calling him out to fight with Satan, and to overcome him in open war. It was an honour which God put upon <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould be called out to play at Cudgels with Satan, and to win the field of him, through the power of Chriſt. It's counted an honour amongſt Souldiers to be ſingled out to ſome difficult ſervice: ſo it is in the Spiritual Warfare.</p>
               <p>And beſides; Such violent Temptations, they are rather hopeful Evidences that we are the Children of God, then otherwiſe; eſpecially, when we find deſires to oppoſe them. Thoſe whom an Enemy hath already in his power, they are not uſually aſſaulted much: Aſſaults are made upon ſuch as are unſubdued, and ſtand out in oppoſition, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What great cauſe all the ſervants of GOD have to be watchful, and to ſtand continually upon their guard, that they may be prepared and provided for theſe evill dayes of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Do not ſay, <hi>I am ſure to be freed from Temptation, the evill one ſhall not come neer me.</hi> This ſecurity is like to bring the evil day ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upon you; and if it come upon you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided, it will be a very ſad day. Souldiers that are beſieged by a ſtrong and watchful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, if they be ſecure &amp; ſleepy may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed on a ſuddain. <hi>Invadunt urbem vino ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<expan>

gives to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Be ſober, be vigilant, becauſe the Devil your Adverſary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about as a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> Satans work is to compaſs the Earth, and to walk up and down in it, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 7. And if he find Chriſtians like the Inhabitants of <hi>Laiſh</hi> ſecure, and quiet, he is much encouraged to make deſperate aſſaults upon them. The Scripture ſpeakes much in the commendation of Holy Fear; it's one of the beſt Preſervatives in the World, to keep the Soul out of ſnares. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth alway; but he that hardeneth his heart ſhall fall into miſchief,</hi> Prov. 28. 14. <hi>Noahs</hi> fear made him prepare an Ark at the Command of God; by which, he and his Family were preſerved, when the reſt of the careleſs World were drowned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. He was fearful, and provided againſt dangers, which were not yet within the Ken of his Eye <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The things, which he provided for, were at a great diſtance 120 years off; He might have reaſoned thus with himſelf, <hi>I may be dead long before the Flood.</hi> He was now 500 years old, and yet he was religiouſly afraid, and ſet himſelf to prepare for it. Satans Temptations are within the clear view of every Chriſtian: therefore, it's prudence to be provided againſt them, and that ſpeedily: And the rather ſhould we do this, becauſe the end of all theſe premonitions is, to ſhake off carnal ſecurity, and to put our ſelves into a fit poſture to receive this Aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:170109:24"/>
What cauſe of thankfulneſſe unto God have all thoſe chriſtians who are freed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from this evill day? Doth God keep Satan chained up that he doth not annoy thee? art thou preſerved from his vexations? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thou haſt cauſe every day to returne praiſes for this unto thy Saviour who keeps thee ſo in ſafety, that the evill one doth not touch thee. And we have the more cauſe to do this (1) becauſe we put our ſelves daily into his hands and yet are preſerved from him; we even allure Satan to ſet upon us, and ſend meſſengers daily to him to invite him to make aſſaults, and yet God is pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him. And then (2) becauſe he is eager to ſet upon us: never was any ravenous hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Lyon more greedy of his prey then Satan is to prey upon the ſoul by temptation. Our Saviour would have us to pray daily that God would keep us out of the devils hands. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evill.</hi> And whatſoever we are to pray againſt as an evill, we ſhould be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God for preſervation from it as a great bleſſing. Did we but feele thoſe heart-akings which ſome of the godly do groan under, by reaſon of the vexations of the Evill one, we would not riſe in the morning, nor go to bed at night, without praiſing God for our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from him.</p>
               <p>This lets us ſee what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſtate of the godly on earth and the <note place="margin">4. Uſe.</note>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:170109:25"/>
ſtate of the godly in Heaven. In this life they are liable to aſſaults, but in the other life they are ſet free from all batteries: here they are militant, there they ſhall be all triumphant: here they walk in Armes, there they ſit with Palms in their hands, Crowns on their heads and white Robes upon their backs. In heaven there's no ſin, and therefore no temptation: the earthly Paradiſe was not free from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but in the celeſtiall Paradiſe, there's no tempter. The Devill for his ſin was once caſt out of Heaven, and there's no re-entry thither, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 8. He hath his dioceſſe on earth, as ye heard out of <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 7. There he rags and there he fights, but he hath no roome in Heaven, he is the Prince of the power of the aire, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. but he can aſcend no higher.

               <p n="1">(1) What ever is poſitively and peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded unto Chriſtians, that ought to be performed: The Command of God layes an obligation upon the ſoul, which is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170109:26"/>
and ſpreading his ſnares, that he may ſurprize and catch us. And ſecondly the Chriſtians Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in reference to theſe aſſaults: He muſt reſiſt ſteadfaſt in the faith. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 27.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The commendable examples which we have in Scripture, are to be imitated; Now we have very Rare examples of this Duty. We have the example of Chriſt, and of holy men, led by the ſpirit of Chriſt. He reſiſted both the immediate, and the mediate Aſſaults of that Wicked-one. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. we have Satan ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to Chriſt in a viſible ſhape, tempting him, and fighting with him. He makes a threefold aſſault, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that theſe ſtones be made bread,</hi> v. 3. <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelfe down,</hi> v. 6. <hi>All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> v. 9. And we finde a threefold oppoſition. It is written, <hi>Man ſhall not live by bread alone, but by the word of God.</hi> v. 4. It is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> v. 7. And again, it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> v. 10. Though our Saviour was patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contented to be buffetted by men, yet he would not endure the buffettings of Satan. When the Jews ſmote him with the palms of their hands, and with reeds upon the head, he made no reſiſtance: but when Satan ſmites him with temptations, then he oppoſed. And when he aſſaulted him by an Inſtrument, we finde he made the ſame Oppoſition. In
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170109:26"/>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 22, 23. Our Saviour had there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed with his Diſciples about his paſſion, verſe 21. <hi>The Son of man muſt go up to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and ſuffer many things of the Elders and chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raiſed again.</hi> The Devill knowing well, that the Death of Chriſt would be the ruine of his kingdom; for he remembred what was threatned in Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head:</hi> Therefore he inſtills this motion into <hi>Peter;</hi> if it were poſſible, to divert him from the work of Redemption. Our Saviour ſeeing from whence this ſuggeſtion came, makes a violent reſiſtance, <hi>Get thee behinde me Satan, thou art an offence unto me.</hi> The very ſame words he uttered to Satan, immediately tempting him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10. he now uſeth to <hi>Peter,</hi> the Deputy of Satan in this action, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And as our Saviour, ſo thoſe who were acted by his ſpirit: <hi>Job</hi> when his Wiſe was made the Devills hand, to convey poyſon into his ſoul, in the evill day of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, he doth reſolutely oppoſe the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: <hi>Curſe God,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>and die, Job</hi> 2. 9. Rid thy ſelf of this intolerable burthen, which is heavier then death it ſelfe. Thou ſpeakeſt, ſaith he, as one of the fooliſh women ſpeake, <hi>What, ſhall we receive good at the hand of the Lord, and ſhall we not receive evill alſo?</hi> verſ. 10. He would not drink of Satans Cup, though his own Wife was made the Cup-bearer, but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170109:27"/>
puts it away from him with indignation, and juſt rebuke.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) We are commanded to pray, that God would not ſuffer us to be led into temptation, ſo as that we ſhould conſent and yield to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evill.</hi> In which Petition we pray, that, if God do ſuffer Satan to break looſe upon us, and to ſhoot his Arrows at us, yet that he would not give us up into his power, but enable us by his grace, that we may never yield with willing conſent, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with any of his Temptations. Now its a ſure Rule, That what good we beg by prayer, from the hand of God, we uſe all lawfull means to accompliſh; And whatſoever evill we pray againſt, that we diligently uſe our own endeavour, by all good means, to avoid and eſchew the ſame; otherwiſe our prayers will be but idle, unbelieving Prayers, &amp; meer taking of the name of God in vain<hi>:</hi> we muſt Work out our ſalvation, as well as Pray that we may be ſaved: yea our very praying for ſalvation, layes this obligation upon us, to work out our ſalvation: Our very praying for our daily bread, bindes us to uſe holy labour and diligence, that we may have bread to eat; and our very praying for remiſſion of ſins, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth us to joyn Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, that our ſins may be forgiven: ſo doth our praying, that we may not be overcome by temptation, engage us to make reſiſtance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170109:27"/>
againſt aſſayling temptation. When the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were endangered by the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> behind, and the red Sea before; <hi>Moſes</hi> cryed unto God by prayer: And when he had done, ſtood ſtill; ſaith God to him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 14. <hi>Wherefore cryeſt thou unto me? Speak unto the Children of Iſrael, that they go forward; but lift thou up thy rod, and ſtretch out thy hand over the Sea, and divide it.</hi> As if God ſhould have ſaid: if you pray to be delivered, you muſt work to be delivered: you muſt watch as well as pray. If you would have me to ſave you, you muſt uſe all lawfull means for your own preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And we have the like reaſoning with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah:</hi> When there was ſuch a defeat received before the City of <hi>Ai</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan, Joſhuah</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fell down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and caſt duſt upon their heads, and make a very patheticall and fervent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. 6. 7, 8. Alas, O Lord God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſt thou at all brought this people over <hi>Jordan,</hi> to deliver us into the hands of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monites,</hi> to deſtroy us, &amp;c? The <hi>Canaanites</hi> and all the Inhabitants of the Land, ſhall hear of it, and ſhall environ us round about, and cut off our name from the earth, &amp;c. Saith God, v. 10, 11, 12, 13. wherefore lyeſt thou thus upon thy face? <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath ſinned and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed my Covenant, &amp;c. Up, ſanctifie the people, &amp;c. As if God ſhould have ſaid, If you do expect to have this breach repayred, you muſt <hi>removere prohibens,</hi> take away that which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170109:28"/>
hath brought upon your ſelves, and which will continue this ill ſucceſs, if it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. Thus for the <hi>Quod ſit, That it is ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>Cur ſit, Why it is ſo.</hi> There is very great reaſon for this Oppoſition.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) From the worth and preciouſneſs of that which lieth at ſtake in this controverſie. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans name is in Hebrew <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and in Greek <hi>Apollyon;</hi> and in Engliſh, <hi>A Deſtroyer, Rev.</hi> 9. 11. And the end of his deſign in all his Aſſaults, is anſwerable to his Name, he comes to rob, kill, and deſtroy; and that not the body and outward man onely, but that which is of more value then all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Immortall Soul.</p>
               <p>Satan ſaith, as the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>Give me the Souls, and take the goods to thy ſelfe.</hi> He matters not who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away all other ſpoyl, ſo that he may have the ſoul for his Dividend. He fights againſt them by his Temptations, that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of that eternall and exceeding weight of glory. <hi>Hold faſt that which thou haſt, that no man take thy Crown. Rev.</hi> 3. 11. Satan doth not contend for Counters, but for Crowns; and thoſe not temporall and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, but eternall and incorruptible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 25. <hi>Non controvertitur de limitibus, ſed de ipſâ haereditate.</hi> You read of an Inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, immortall, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for you. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. The end of all Satans Aſſaults, is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170109:28"/>
to wipe you of this Inheritance. He aſſaults you, that he may bring you into bondage to his Common-wealth and Tyranny, the worſt of all Tyrannies. Contentions and oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for triviall and trifling matters, are not worth taking up; and if they be taken up, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very prudent man will ſoon lay them aſleep; but when great things are at ſtake, Cowards will be valiant. Such is the matter of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians oppoſition. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) From the juſtneſs and lawfulneſs of the Warre. There are two things which make a Warre lawfull and juſt. 1. The Call of a juſt Authority. 2. A juſt cauſe. If either of theſe be wanting, there can be no comfort in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking any Warre. To go forth in any publique Warre againſt any, without the Call of lawfull Authority, is to commit murther. I ſay in publique Warre, becauſe in caſe of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity, when a man is aſſaulted by Theeves and Robbers <hi>(pro termino in diviſibili</hi> for that very inſtant) he is his own Magiſtrate. <hi>Andrews</hi> upon the Commandments. p. 741. <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 2. <hi>Neceſsitas dicit legem Legi.</hi> Its obſerved, that when <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was dead, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not go out to warre though with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> whom God had devoted to deſtruction, till they had received Authority from God, they would firſt have a lawfull Guide, <hi>Judge</hi> 1. 1. After the death of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> it came to paſſe, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> asked of the Lord, ſaying, Who ſhall
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170109:29"/>
goe up for us againſt the Canaanites firſt, to fight againſt them? And <hi>David</hi> would not fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> untill he had a commiſſion from <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 17. 37.</p>
               <p>And to undertake a war when the cauſe is not juſt, is no leſſe then a breach of the ſame commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the magiſtrate who makes ſuch a war: for whether the private perſon who is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is to diſpute the law fullneſſe of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces war; or whether he be not engaged to aſſiſt upon his command, if he know not the war to be abſolutely unrighteous, is a great diſpute; but it is without controverſy that the Authority making an unlawfull war, is guilty of Murther. But now in this matter, there is a concurrence of both theſe, (1) you have a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Authority calling you out to fight. God who is the Supreme Authority, to whomall creatures owe obedience and ſubjection, he calls you to make oppoſition againſt Satan.</p>
               <p>And then. (2) The cauſe is very juſt. For Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in aſſaulting any of the Children of God is a meer uſurper: he hath no right over you, you are not his but the Lords, by creation, by redemption, by ſpeciall dedication, &amp;c. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is <hi>Tyrannus ſine titulo:</hi> you do but defend your own ſouls, and the Territory and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of God and Jeſus Chriſt in you and over you, whoſe Dominion you are bound to preſerve.</p>
               <p n="3">3 From the Neceſſity of oppoſing: There's
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170109:29"/>
no other meanes which can do us any good, if this be neglected. There are but theſe four things which can be imagined to help an aſſaulted Chriſtian. Flying, Yielding, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, &amp; Oppoſing; now none of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the laſt, will be available in this caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Flying is to no purpoſe: Whither can he Fly? (1) There's no caſtle or place of refuge on earth which can keepe out Satan. The Devils are Spirits, <hi>Spirituall wickedneſſes, Eph.</hi> 6. 12. and we know no earthly place can keep out a Spirit. Spirits have not fleſh and bones, they can eaſily penetrate into any place: you cannot keep out the ayre out of any cloſe Dungeon; and how then can you keep out Satan who is more ſpirituall then the ayre or the light? (2) The Devill is ſwift of foot, he can eaſily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake you, if you ſhould fly. And ti's obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that in all the ſpirituall Armour there is nothing appointed to cover the backparts. If you once turne your back, you give the Devill a faire marke where his Arrows will preſently faſten.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yielding will not helpe you; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is a very mercileſſe creature: he that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himſelfe to his fury, puts the Knife into his own bowels. The Devill gives no quarter to any ſinner that ever yeelds ſome. Say of the Lyon, that he will ſpare the prey that lyeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet; but this roaring Lyon the Devill is moſt cruell to them that ſtoope. And then beſides; he that yeelds, puts himſelfe out of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170109:30"/>
compaſſe of Chriſts prayer. I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not, <hi>Luc.</hi> 22. 32. Chriſt doth not make interceſſion for yeelding ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but for oppoſing ſinners; he prayes that the faith of contending ſinners do not faile, but he doth not intercede that ſuch as will not fight, ſhould be defended.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Compounding is unavayleable: Satan will never make any compoſition but for his own advantage: and the Devills advantage will be the ſinners detriment if not his deſtruction. And beſides; if he ſhould ſeale to any good termes, yet would he keepe none. He is a perfidious creature, as wel as a mercileſſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: when he ſpeaketh a lie, he ſpeaketh of his own; forhe is a lyar, and the Father there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. I will be a lying Spirit in the mouth of all his Prophets, ſaith Satan to God, when he had power given him over <hi>Ahab.</hi> 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 22. 22. He is a diſſembler, therefore when he maketh his voyce gracious, believe him not: for there are ſeven abominations in his heart, <hi>Pro.</hi> 27. 25. The Devill ſomtimes transforms himſelfe into an Angell of light, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11. 14, but he is never more an Angell of darkneſſe than when he is transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Angell of light. He is never a greater enemy then when he appeares in the ſhape of a friend. When he ſet upon our firſt parents, he came to them as a friend, pretending his griefe that they were debarred from the tree of knowledge, &amp; makes himſelf a greater friend
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170109:30"/>
than God was. Hath God ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall not eat of every tree in the Garden?</hi> Gen. 3. 1. as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>My ſoul is troubled for you,</hi> that the deſire of your ſoul ſhould be with-held from you: take but my counſel, your condition ſhall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd: But what was at the bottome of that friendſhip, we find by ſad experience. When he ſet upon the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> he pretends the like friendſhip to him; <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe ſtones be made bread,</hi> Mat. 4. 3. He ſeemes to be much affected, that a perſon of ſuch worth as Chriſt was, ſhould want bread, after forty dayes faſting; but his intention was to have choked Chriſt, and all his Elect, with his bread. If ever Satan reach out his hand to kiſs you, be ſure there is a dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger under his garment to ſtab you; like <hi>Judas,</hi> he hath the greateſt prank of Treaſon to act, <hi>When he comes with an Hail Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(4) From the benefit of reſiſting: As there is hazard of ruine in ſubmitting; ſo there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Victory in oppoſing. When Chriſt had made avaliant reſiſtance, the <hi>text</hi> ſaith, the Devil gave way, &amp; left him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 11. And ſo wil he, at leaſt, be inforced to leave, if you continue in your oppoſition. We have not onely a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for this, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 7. but we have many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences: <hi>Job,</hi> by his conſtancy in oppoſing, over-came the Tempter at laſt: God appeares in the end of the battel, and gives him the garland <hi>Cap.</hi> 42. 7, 8. <hi>Peter</hi> was ſifted much, but he overcame at laſt. <hi>Paul</hi> was long and ſorely
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170109:31"/>
buffeting; yet triumphed before his death in that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> or ſong of Victory, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. and is now in deſpight of the Devil a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Saint. And all that glorious Company in Heaven, who are deſcribed with Palms in their hands, and Robes upon their backs, and Crowns upon their heads, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9. are at this preſent, ſinging the ſong of Victory unto God, and unto the Lamb.</p>
               <p>Reproof to two ſorts of perſons: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>

               </p>
               <p>(1.) Such as, inſtead of withſtanding Satan the evil Spirit, withſtand and oppoſe the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, quenching, and grieving, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting his bleſſed Motions. <hi>Steven</hi> ſayes this to the charge of thoſe obſtinate Jews, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 51. <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked, and uncircumciſed in heart and eares, ye have alwayes reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt; as your Fathers did, ſo do ye.</hi> There are many in this way of oppoſition, reſiſting the Spirit in the Miniſtry of the Word, and in the immediate motions and ſuggeſtions put into their hearts. When the Spirit moves them to pray, they oppoſe him: When the Spirit bids them hear, they ſtop their eares; and when the Spirit bids them, <hi>Seek ye my face;</hi> they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Thy face will we</hi> not <hi>ſeek.</hi> I would have ſuch men to conſider a few things ſeriouſly: Theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There's no man knows whether the Spirit will move once more in his heart, or no: That which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith in another caſe, we may as truly ſay in this caſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 8. There is no
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170109:31"/>
man hath power over the Spirit, to retain the Spirit. The Spirit of God is a free Agent; He workes when, and where, and as long as he pleaſeth; he bloweth where he liſteth, &amp;c. Many a man would now be glad to feel thoſe movings upon his ſoul, which he hath ſtifled formerly by his own ſinful oppoſings, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not redeem them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How unable you will be to act in any good, when the Holy Spirit of God is ſilenced. <hi>'Tis the Spirit of God which workes in you, both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2. 23. And if this Wheel do not turn, there will never be any good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Soul. The Soul without the Holy Spirit, is but as a dead Corps with a living ſoul, not able to act at all: If there be neither Wind nor Tide, the Ship cannot ſayl. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is both the Wind and Tide of all Motions in the ſoul; and if this ſtir not, there is no action. It is with man, in regard of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual operations, as it was with the Wheeles in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion, and the living Creatures, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 19, 20. 21. <hi>When the living Creatures went, the Wheeles went by them; and when the living Creatures ſtood, the Wheeles stood; and when the living Creatures were lifted up, the Wheeles were lifted up</hi> &amp;c. The Soul of Man is a Wheel which is fit for motion; but it cannot move when the Spirit of God doth not move: If the Spirit ſtand ſtill, the Wheeles ſtand ſtill; and if the Spirit be lifted up, the Wheeles are lifted up: otherwiſe no motion.</p>

(2.) Such as inſtead of withſtanding the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults of Satan, do indeed carry on the aſſaults of Satan; uſe all meanes they can, that they may both faſhion, and animate, and give breath to all Satans Conceptions, in their own, and others hearts. <hi>They hatch the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice eggs, and weave the Spiders web,</hi> Iſa. 59. 5. They are ready to put Tooles and Inſtruments into the hand of the Devil, and to do his work for him. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſome that <hi>make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the lusts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13. <hi>ult.</hi> So, many make proviſion for the Devil, that they may accompliſh his temptations: They uſe all means to edge his temptations, that they may pierce to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome: they put feathers upon his arrows, that they may fly ſwiftly. <hi>Jonadab</hi> was guilty of this ſinne towards <hi>Ammon; He ſets on the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Devil, and promotes ſinne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Pander to his luſt,</hi> 2 Sam. 13. 4, 5. <hi>Jezabel</hi> ſhe promotes Satans temptation againſt her husband; I <hi>wil,</hi> ſaith ſhe <hi>give thee the vineyard of Naboth,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 21. 7. She became a very Devil to her Husband, ſo do many perſons to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves go up and down, ſeeking occaſions and opportunities, to further Satans temptation. If Satan tempt them to drunkenneſs, they go preſently abroad to ſeek Companions; and if he perſwade them to uncleanneſs, they uſe all helpes and incentives to that ſinne, &amp;c. It is a very curſed thing, and a ſacrilegious ſin, to help the Devil againſt Chriſt, either in your
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170109:32"/>
ſelves, or others. The Serpent was curſed for being an Inſtrument to the Adverſary, in his aſſaulting of our firſt Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 14. And <hi>Jezabel</hi> bears this infamous brand; <hi>She made</hi> Ahab <hi>to ſin. Jezabel</hi> his wife ſtirred up, &amp;c. Such as blow up Satans ſparks of temptation in their own hearts are <hi>Felones de ſe,</hi> Self-Murtherers, which of all Murtherers are the moſt bloody, and confiſcate all they have.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2.</note> this reſolution. Play the men, and ſtand out againſt the Devil and all his Inſtruments. Keep your footing, and yield not in any caſe; though he come upon you, as <hi>Goliah</hi> did upon <hi>David,</hi> with open mouth; yet keep your ground, and flinch not at any hand. And for your encouragement, conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That Satan is but a Creature, though he be ſtrong and cruel; yet his ſtrength is but a created ſtrength: he is potent, but not omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent. Omnipotency is incompatible to a Creature. He is the ſtrong man armed; but Jeſus Chriſt is ſtronger then he: and though you cannot, yet he can diſarm him, and take away that wherein he truſteth, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 22.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That he is a Creature under a Curſe: This may take off much from that dreadfulneſs which many look upon him with, <hi>vid. Gen.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Curſed ſhalt thou be above all the Beasts of the field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. There is nothing which may more encourage a Child of God in his ſpiritual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170109:33"/>
then this, That all he diſpures againſt are under a Divine Execration: Gods Curſe is a weakning thing.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) He is a wounded and conquered Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>He ſhall break thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel.</hi> Our Saviour, I remember, encourageth his Diſciples againſt troubles from the World, by this very Argument, <hi>I have overcome the World,</hi> Joh. 16. 33. He hath overcome the Devil, as well as the World, for he triumphed over Principalities and Powers on the Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. Chriſt put Satan to flight in his aſſaults, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 11. and that as our Head. Satan overcame all Mankind in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> but in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by all the Elect in Chriſts Victories, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 6. So in this.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) He is a chained Creature alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 1, 2. <hi>God</hi> keeps him faſt in Irons; he was put into Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ever ſince his (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4.) firſt Rebellion, and he cannot ſhake them off, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. And this chain doth ſo confine him, that he cannot ſtir, until God ſlack his Chain. <hi>Let me touch his fleſh and bone, and he will curſe thee to thy face;</hi> Job 2. 5. And ye know he was not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Herd of Swine, till Chriſt had ſlackened his chain, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 32. how much more is a Saint better then a Swine? I ſhall to theſe Encouragements add one more: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your Sacramental Oath in Baptiſme made to God: then it was, you took Preſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money to ſerve in Gods wars; And that you
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170109:33"/>
ſhould oppoſe the Devil, was a part of your engagements: Perjury is a hainous ſinne; the very light of Nature abhors it, and God hath, and will ſeverely avenge it, <hi>vid. Zech.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
               <p>Now if you would Oppoſe to any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, you ſhould be carefull of theſe three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Study his ſtratagems, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. This will help you much in Oppoſing. The Apoſtle, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 11. mentions his wiles.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Oppoſe him at a diſtance: It's beſt fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an enemy in his own Territories; prudent Warriours endeavour to do ſo.</p>

               <p>VVE have done with the <note place="margin">LECT. 5</note> 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. Doctrine, That it's the duty of a Chriſtian to withſtand Satan in the evill day of temptation: The third Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whoſoever would be able to withſtand Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> in the evill day of Aſſault, muſt be carefull that he take to himſelf the whole Armour of God. This is twice told us in this Chapter: once in the 11. Verſe; and here again in this Verſe, to ſhew you the certainty, and neceſſity of it. There can be no hopes of doing any good againſt the Devil when he ſets upon us; no poſſibility of withſtanding to any purpoſe; without the taking and uſing of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
               <p>In the handling of this Propoſition, I ſhall briefly ſpeak to theſe four Heads:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1) I ſhall ſhew what this Armour is.</item>
                  <item>(2) Why it's called the Armour of God.</item>

(3) Why Chriſtians muſt take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves this Armour?</item>
                  <item>(4) Why they muſt take the whole Armor of God?</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jerome</hi> thinkes, <hi>by the whole Armour of God,</hi> we are to underſtand Chriſt, ſo as, To put on the Armour of God, is nothing elſe but, To put on Chriſt; <hi>Si enim eingulum veritas eſt, &amp; lorica juſtitia eſt; Salvator autem, &amp; veritas &amp; juſtitia nominatur, nulli dubium quin ipſe cingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ſit &amp; lorica,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But I ſuppoſe in this place, by the <hi>Armour of God,</hi> we are to underſtand theſe two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>The Graces of Gods Spirit;</hi> ſuch as Faith, Hope, Patience, &amp;c. This the Apoſtle clearly ſheweth in the following verſes, where he reckoneth up the particulars of this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi> He mentions the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Hope, the Breaſt-plate of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the girdle of Truth, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 16, 17. Hereby intimating to us, that theſe, and ſuch like graces of God, are thoſe ſpiritual Armes which Chriſtians ſhould uſe in this Warfare, <hi>vid. Rom.</hi> 13. 12. Graces are called, <hi>The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Light:</hi>

                  </gap>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The Ordinances of God:</hi> ſuch as the Word, Prayer, Sacraments, &amp;c. This alſo is hinted by the Apoſtle in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes, where he commands us to uſe Prayer, as one of theſe Weapons: under which particular, I conceive, by a <hi>Synecdoché,</hi> all the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170109:35"/>
other Ordinances of God are comprehended: ſo that the whole <hi>Spiritual Armour</hi> is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under one of theſe two Heads; of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Graces,</hi> and <hi>Divine Ordinances.</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4. The <hi>Ordinances</hi> are called, <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Now theſe are called <hi>Armour;</hi> becauſe they are of the ſame uſe to the ſoul, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Armes are to the outward Man: To defend the ſoul from Aſſaults, and to offend and wound aſſaulting Enemies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, why it's called the <hi>Armour of God?</hi> For this, let us conſider theſe four Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>Becauſe it is of Divine Original.</hi> God is the ſole Author and Maker of this Armour: (1.) For the Graces of the Spirit, we know that they are of a Divine deſcent: he makes and workes them in the ſoul. It is above created Art, or Strength, to plant any of theſe Flowers in the ſoul. They are called the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. They are of the Spirits planting: he is therefore called <hi>the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Zach. 12. 10. And God is called <hi>the God of all Grace,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 10. <hi>The God of all Grace who hath called us into his eternal glory by Chriſt Jeſus, after ye have ſuffered a while, make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. And for the Ordinances, they are alſo Divine Inſtitutions, prayer, preaching, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are all of Gods appointment. He gave ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170109:35"/>
Prophets, ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the work of the Miniſtry, &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. 12. None of the Ordinances could have any ſpirituall <note place="margin">Math. 28. 19</note> efficacy, if they had not a divine Originall.</p>
               <p>They could neither convince the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor convert the heart: they could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terrifie, nor comfort, caſt down, nor lift up the ſoul, if they were not of a heavenly Deſcent.</p>
               <p>(2.) As this Armour is of Divine Originall, <hi>ſo it hath a Divine Approbation.</hi> God hath given his Approbation to this Armour, and to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He hath manifeſted his Allowance of it both,</p>
               <p>1. By the many Commands given to all his Souldiers, that they ſhould uſe it, he hath charged them poſitively, that whenſoever they go out to battel, they ſhould gird themſelves herewith. And</p>
               <p>2. By the many ſignall and remarkable Victories he hath beſtowed upon his Servants, when they have been carefull to make uſe of it, he hath alwayes given them good ſucceſs. Herewith <hi>Job</hi> overcame, and herewith <hi>Paul</hi> came off victorious; and by this Armour, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was promiſed the Conqueſt, when Satan ſifted him. God is exceedingly pleaſed with theſe Weapons, he delights in the graces of his ſpirit, and in his people for thoſe graces. How pleaſant art thou, O love for delights<hi>! Cant.</hi> 7. 6. And he takes much contentment in his own Ordinances alſo. Let me ſee thy
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170109:36"/>
countenance, let me hear thy voice; for ſweet is thy voice; and thy countenance is comely, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 14. And therefore the Church prayes, <hi>Let my prayer come forth in thy ſight, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and the lifting up of my hands, as the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſacrifice. Pſal.</hi> 141. 2. And therefore alſo it is, that God is alwayes preſent with his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and with his Servants, whenſoever they are either publiquely, or privately exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in them.</p>
               <p>3. They may be called the Armour of God, <hi>In regard of Conſervation.</hi> God doth uphold, maintain, and preſerve this Armour, They are in his cuſtody and keeping, he takes the care of them.</p>
               <p>If we look upon our graces, the Scripture makes it very clear, that as they are planted, ſo they are preſerved by God. He that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the feet of his Saints, keepeth much more the graces of his Saints. Awake ô North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde, and come ô South, blow upon my Garden, that the ſpices thereof may flow forth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. If God did not exerci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e his providentiall care in preſerving, as well as he put forth his creating Power, in planting grace at firſt: the roots of grace would not onely, not blow forth, but die, and come to nothing in a ſhort time: faith is that which keeps us; but it is God which keeps our faith, and all our other graces are in his hand.</p>
               <p>And as our graces, ſo are the Ordinances alſo preſerved, and maintained by God. Theſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170109:36"/>
Candles would ſoon be blown out, if he did not keep them burning by his continual care and watchful providence. As Chriſt hath the Stars in his right hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1. ſo he hath all the Ordinances in his right hand.</p>
               <p>(4.) They are the Armour of God, <hi>In regard of their ſucceſs and efficacy.</hi> All the vertue of this Armour, depends wholly upon God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, &amp; not upon the Creature; (1) for our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they are ſtrengthened by his power, <hi>Iſay</hi> 41. 10. <hi>Fear not, I am with thee, be not afraid, I am thy God, I will ſtrengthen thee, yea I will help thee, yea I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteouſneſs.</hi> Our Faith, and Hope, and all our graces would be broken to ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, at one ſtroak of temptation, if the Lord did not eſtabliſh and confirm them. <hi>I will ſtrengthen the houſe of Judah, and I will ſave the houſe of Joſeph, and I will ſtrengthen them in the Lord, and they ſhall walk up and down in his name,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Zech:</hi> 10. 6. 12, This is that which our Saviour tells <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22. 32. <hi>I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not.</hi> We could never reſiſt the violent aſſaults of Satan, if the Lord did not undergird our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with his own Almighty ſtrength. This is plainly laid down in this very Chapter, verſe 10. 11. be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, <hi>Put on the whole Armour of God.</hi> God will not ſtrengthen us, if we neglect this Armour, and this Armour will not be able to defend us, unleſs God give it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170109:37"/>
power. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Pauls</hi> graces would preſently have been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> had not Gods ſtrength been perfected in his weak graces. This power made them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable.</p>
               <p>(2.) For your Ordinances of God, which are the other part of this Armour, It is from God that they are enabled to do us good in temptation. <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God, for the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of ſtrong holds,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per walls of prayer, preaching, Sacraments, are ſo thin, that they would never hold out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the ſtrong Gun-ſhots of Satan, were they not fortified by a greater power then their own. Theſe Glaſſe-windows could not hold out in theſe violent ſtorms, if they were not covered with the ſtrong Curtains of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power. Theſe Sandy banks would be waſhed away with one ſingle flood of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the ſtrength of the Almighty did not ſtand as an invincible Breaſt-work to ſecure them: theſe Pitchers would preſently be daſhed in pieces, and theſe dim Lamps ſoon extinguiſhed; did not God uphold them. The Sword of the Lord, and of <hi>Gideon:</hi> this was <hi>Gideons</hi> word, when he went with his Pitchers againſt the <hi>Midianites, Jude</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Gideons</hi> Sword would ſoon have been beaten out of his hands, had not the Sword of the Lord been drawn to defend his Sword. The
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170109:37"/>
Ordinances of God are but like a Barley Cake which would never tumble down, againſt the Hoſts of this King of <hi>Midian,</hi> did not the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> take them into his own hand, and put power into it.</p>
               <p>3. Why ſhould Chriſtians take unto them this Armour. I ſhall give theſe two Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1) <hi>From the uneffectualneſs of all other Armor.</hi> It is impoſſible to prevail againſt the Devil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other way. There are but three kinds of Weapons. The Weapons of men, The Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of the Devil, and the Weapons of God. (1.) The Weapons of men are ſuch as carnall reaſon puts into our hands: as Phyſick, and pleaſant Company, and earthly delights, &amp;c. Theſe will not ſerve us in this Warre. Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians may do ſome good to purge out Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and other abounding humours, which Satan makes ſome uſe of, to help him in his aſſaults; but this will not do the cure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. The aſſault is made not upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but upon the ſoul; and the bodily Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian cannot give any receipt to antidote that. They may antidote the body againſt peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall infections; but the Apothecaries Shop hath no Medicine which can preſerve the ſoul from a temptation, nor heal a ſpirituall wound. There are ſome bodily diſeaſes which they cannot cure; there are <hi>ſcandala medico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> We read of a diſeaſed Woman in the Goſpel, which had been many years under
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170109:38"/>
the hands of many Phyſicians, but could not be cured till ſhe was touched by the hand of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 26. And if a bodily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe put them ſo to it, what help can the ſoul have from them in a day of temptation? As <hi>Job</hi> ſaid to his friends, when they reaſoned with him, ſo it may be ſaid to the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and religious of Phyſitians; Ye are all Phyſitians of no value, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 4. In this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſoul, the Conſcience, the inward man is not the ſubject of the Phyſicians Act, but the body. I ſhall conclude this with that which God ſpeaks concerning <hi>Ephraim</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 13. <hi>When Ephraim ſaw his ſickneſs, and Judah ſaw his wound, then went E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim to the Aſſyrian, and ſent to King Jareb, yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</hi> If a Colledge of Phyſicians were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened together, to preſcribe remedy for a ſoul vexed with temptation, they could adminiſter nothing effectuall to heal ſuch a wound. Nor will pleaſant Company, nor earthly delights do any good in this caſe. They may a little alleviate for a time, but they cannot cure. The Servants of <hi>Saul,</hi> when they ſaw their Lord troubled with an evill ſpirit, adviſe him to this way of Remedy: Let our Lord command thy Servants which are before thee, to ſeek out a man who is a cunning player on a Harp; and it ſhall come to paſſe, when the evill ſpirit from God is upon thee, that he ſhall play with his hand, and thou ſhalt be well, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 15,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170109:38"/>
16. But although <hi>David</hi> by his Muſick chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for the preſent, as is recorded, ver. 23. yet the diſeaſe was not cured, the evill ſpirit returned to him again afterwards. Carnall delights, and ſinful pleaſures, they are the Devills Engines which help him on with his work upon your ſoul: they are his Proneers, which make the rough places ſmooth, they make the breaches of the ſoul wider then they were before, that Satan now enters more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then he did, and ſpoyls the ſoul, though perhaps more inſenſibly, yet not leſs violently. <hi>Sauls</hi> Armour will do no good againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 38. 39. And as the Weapons of men cannot profit, much leſſe can (2.) the weapons of Satan do any good. Exorciſmes, ſpels, inchantments, croſſings, &amp; ſuch like Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolicall Devices, are very unlike to help the ſoul in theſe Battels. This is to caſt out Satan by Satan, which our Saviour makes to be a very improbable thing. How can Satan caſt out Satan? <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 23. The Devil is a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Creature, too wiſe to make Engines to annoy himſelf. Diviſion would ſoon deſtroy his Kingdom, therefore he will not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf; Or if he do ſeem to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at any time, by any of theſe weapons, which he puts into thy hand, it is but that he may by this means make thee faſter in his ſnare. A wiſe Souldier will ſuſpect any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſent from his enemy: when <hi>Saul</hi> went to the Witch at <hi>Endor,</hi> to be relieved in his evill
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170109:39"/>
day, Satan anſwered him; but he did by this means get faſter hold then he had before: ſo vain are all theſe weapons.</p>
               <p>(2) From the effectualneſſe of theſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: they have ever been ſuccesfull when they have been uſed aright by any of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: What is ſaid of the bow of <hi>Jonathan</hi> and the ſword of <hi>Saul</hi> is truely ſaid of this Armour, they never returned empty from the blood of the ſlain, and from the fat of the mighty, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 22. never any harneſſed with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour loſt the field finally. 'Tis Armour of proofe, it may be battered, it cannot be quite broken. There are thouſands and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in heaven triumphing at this day, who have overcome that red Dragon, and all his hoſts by this Armour.</p>
               <p>IV. Why we muſt take the <hi>whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) Becauſe Satan will be ſure to encounter us on every ſide, he uſeth all kind of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, beſiegeth us round, and therefore we muſt have all kind of Armour. He hath temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for the head, therefore we muſt have a Helmet to keep that ſafe: he hath temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the heart, therefore we muſt take the Breaſt-plate: he hath temptations for the feet, therefore we muſt not leave off the ſhooes of the preparation of the Goſpel, &amp;c. There is not any part of the ſoul or body, but he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults it with peculiar and proper temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. No man knowes where Satan will ſhoot.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:170109:39"/>
(2.) Becauſe if any place lie unguarded, it will be as dangerous, as if the whole were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed. Satan will creep in at any hole; and whereſoever he ſmites, he ſmites mortally. 'Tis as good to have all naked, as any part unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned. Satan is an exact Marks-man, he can ſhoot at an hairs breadth, and not miſſe the Mark, as its ſaid of thoſe <hi>Benjamites, Judges</hi> 20. 16.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) There is ſuch a connexion between one part and another, that the abſence of but one weakeneth the ſtrength of all the reſt. For the Graces of the ſpirit: there is ſuch a concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation amongſt them, that if one be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, all the reſt are much looſened and made leſſe ſerviceable. They are as links of a Chain, one helps to keep another; ſo that if you do but break one, the reſt drop aſunder. <hi>Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4. All the graces are as the ſtones of a building, or the beams of an houſe, they corroborate and ſtrengthen one another: faith ſtrengthens love, and love helps faith, and love and faith quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens hope, and hope ſets joy on work, &amp;c. It were eaſie to ſhew you what mutuall depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance one of the graces hath upon another. And ſo do the Ordinances which are another part of this Armour, they help one another: the word helps us in prayer, and prayer help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> us in managing the word, and the word and prayer make the Sacraments uſefull, and the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170109:40"/>
Sacraments again they fit the ſoul for the word and prayer, &amp;c. So that he that ſhall neglect any piece, doth neceſſarily much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerve all the reſt.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) He that ſhall neglect any, may expect that God ſhould even curſe the reſt to him, as a puniſhment of that neglect. For to leave off any piece of the ſpirituall Armour willingly, argues in a man, (1.) Spirituall pride and confidence of his own ſtrength; he thinks himſelf not to want ſo much as God hath provided: it argues, (2.) Diſeſteem of that peece of Armour which is neglected, that there is neither deſireableneſs, nor uſefulneſs in it: and it (3.) argues ſloathfulneſs and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſpirit: and then it argues (4.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and his Authority, in preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing what he would have his Souldiers to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, &amp;c. For as the Apoſtle argues in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, he that ſaid, <hi>Do not commit Adultery,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>Do not kill, &amp;c. James</hi> 2. 11. ſo he that ſaith, <hi>take the Helmet,</hi> ſaith alſo, <hi>take the Shield, &amp;c.</hi> Now ſuch a Chriſtian may juſtly expect, that God will puniſh his pride and diſreſpect, and ſloathfulneſs, and contempt, with the blaſting of all other pieces of his Armour, that he that would not take all, ſhould have no benefit of any.</p>

                  <hi>for a Chriſtian to oppoſe Satan, when he comes in a way of Aſſault.</hi> This is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally infer'd from hence, All the Armour of God muſt be taken, and all little enough to furniſh us for this day. Many an ignorant and ſelf-confident Chriſtian thinks it one of the eaſieſt works in all the world, to repell Satan, and put him to flight: 'tis but bidding him defiance, and he is preſently gone. This Text will teach us another leſſon, if we mark it well.</p>
               <p>We may gueſſe at the difficulty of oppoſing a contrary power, by the proviſion made for that oppoſition: When we ſee many hundreds of Souldiers liſted, and ſtore of Artillery and Ammunition provided, and many dayes ſpent in fitting the Souldier for his work, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently imagine, that all this preſuppoſeth more then an ordinary adverſary: ſo when we hear the Apoſtle charging theſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> once, and again to take to themſelves, and to put upon them the whole Armour of God: we cannot but conclude, that there is like to be more
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170109:41"/>
than ordinary contentions before ſuch an Adverſary be overcome. Look but upon that deſcription which is made of this Adverſary, in the 12. <hi>v.</hi> of this Chapter, <hi>Not with fleſh and blood, but with Principalities and Powers,</hi> &amp;c. I name this difficulty, not to diſcourage any Chriſtian but to ſtir up watchfulneſs, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in all Chriſtians, that knowing the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty before-hand, they may be the better fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to entertain him when he comes. Three things well conſidered, beſides this in the Text, will diſcover the difficulty of withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Satans temptations.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He is a very potent enemy, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Principalities, Powers, Spiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſses in heavenly places.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. He is a very ſubtle enemy, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1.</item>
                  <item>3. He is a very diligent and induſtrious enemy: <hi>He compaſſeth the earth to and fro,</hi> Job 2. 2.</item>
               </list>
               <p>He turnes every ſtone, and leaves no meanes unattempted, that may promote his miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous deſign.</p>
               <p>Now I add this Note, for theſe three Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons<hi>:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That we may ſee, How much compaſſion we owe to ſuch as are aſſaulted by him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How much we ought to pitty ſuch as are ſurpriſed, overtaken, and for a time overcome by his ſtrong aſſaults: Be not over-harſh, nor over-rigid in cenſuring, &amp; condemning them
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170109:41"/>
who are captivated by the power of Satan, <hi>vid. Gal.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That all who are inabled to keep the field in this war, may confeſs how much they owe to God, who inableth them to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors in ſo difficult a battel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>This ſheweth us the inſufficiency, weakneſs, and emptineſs of our ſelves, and of every thing in our ſelves, to carry on the ſpirituall War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</hi> We muſt take, not our own Armour, that's quickly broken into pieces, but the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God.</hi> Had we any thing of our own, there would be no need of ſending us to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treaſury. There is ſo much Atheiſme, Pride, ſelf-Idolatry, and vain confidence in the heart of man, that he is very deſirous to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie himſelf, and unwilling to acknowledge his own poverty. We are ready to ſay as that proud King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> did, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 13, 14. <hi>By the ſtrength of my hand I have done it, and by my wiſdome, for I am prudent; I have removed the hounds of the people, and have robbed their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and I have put down the Inhabitants like a valiant man. And my hand hath found as a Neſt the riches of the people,</hi> &amp;c. never minding that all his ſucceſs and ſtrength was from <hi>God</hi> who had made him his Battle-axe to do all that work. We are ready to aſſume all to our ſelves, in our ſpirituall warring againſt Satan. I have put the Adverſary to flight; I have reſiſted him by my own ſtrength and induſtry: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is <hi>GOD</hi> that furniſheth us with Armour,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170109:42"/>
and that girds this Armour upon us, and that makes our endeavours ſucceſsfull by his own grace. Our ſword would ſoon be broken in pieces; our heeles would ſoon be tript up from under us, if <hi>God</hi> did not under-gird our ſoules with his ſtrength. <hi>My grace is ſufficient,</hi> ſaith <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Paul, when Satan made war againſt him,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 9. <hi>God</hi>'s grace was <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,</hi> elſe he had been the Devils Vaſſal. <hi>By thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, have I run thorow a troop, by my God have I leaped over a wall; it is God that girdeth me with ſtrength, and maketh my way perfect. He teacheth my hands to war, ſo that a bow of ſteel is broken by my arms. Thou haſt alſo given me the ſhield of thy ſalvation, thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleneſs hath made me great. Thou haſt girded me with ſtrength unto the battel, thou haſt ſubdued under me, thoſe that roſe againſt me,</hi> Pſal. 18. 29, 34, 35, 39. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou readeſt this Text, that thou art ſent to <hi>Gods Armory,</hi> ſit down, and make acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of thy own poverty; and ſay, <hi>All my ſprings are in thee.</hi> God will never have the glory either of thy oppoſing, or overcoming, till thou ſee it to be him that worketh all thy works in thee, and for thee, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. 12.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That God hath made ſufficient provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for his people to ſafeguard and defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the attempts of Satan.</hi> Here is a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noplia,</hi> not only one ſort of Armour but Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of all kinds. The treaſury is richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the chriſtian ſouldier needeth not to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170109:42"/>
want any thing, if he be not defective to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, here is proviſion for the head, for the breaſt, for the heart, for the hand, &amp;c. tis a perfect Armour, (Cap a pe) there's nothing wanting for the full accoutring of ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Let Satan uſe what way of Aſſaults he pleaſeth, here is defence made againſt him, my grace is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for thee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. As the hills ſtand about <hi>Jeruſalem: So the Lord is, round about</hi> his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. 1, 2. There's no ſide lies undefended if the Chriſtian do not voluntarily omit his Armour. <hi>There is none like unto the God of</hi> Jeſurun, <hi>who rideth upon the heaven for thy helpe, and the eternall God is thy refuge and underneath are the everlaſting Armes,</hi> &amp;c: Deut. 33. 26, 27. If Satan come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their heads to aſſault them, God rideth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sky in his excellency: If Satan get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them to undermine them, there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion alſo: underneath are the everlaſting Armes, <hi>Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing, go ye out of the mid'st of her, &amp;c. For ye ſhall not go out with haſte, nor go by flight for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Iſrael will be your rereward, Eſa</hi> 52. 11, 12. If Satan ſet upon them in the Front, they ſhall be defended there, <hi>God will go before them;</hi> And if he fall upon the Rear, to cut off the hind-moſt of them, as <hi>Amaleck</hi> did on <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> even there alſo ſhal be ſufficient <hi>proviſion;</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wil be their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170109:43"/>
Rereward. Earthly Generals are many times conſtrained to call the Souldiery to fight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed or half armed; they have not all ſorts of Weapons at all Encounters. God never bids any of his Souldiers fight, but he firſt layes out for them all kind of Weapons. I add this Note, for this conſideration: To let a Chriſtian ſee, that if he be at any time foiled in theſe diſputes, he is not to blame Gods Armour, which is very compleat and perfect; but either his own negligence, in not putting on his Arms, or his cowardize in not uſing them aright. We may ſay of the Spiritual Armour, as the Apoſtle doth of the Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>All Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. So is the Armour of God, profitable for Offence, for Defence, to make the Chriſtian Souldier compleat, throughly furniſhed for every kind of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That Chriſtian endeavour is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for thoſe who would be preſerved and ſecured from Satan in the day of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> This is gathered cleerly from the Apoſtles charge of Taking unto us, and of Putting on this Armour. God hath provided us compleat armes; but if we deſire either to defend our ſelves, or to offend our enemies, there lyeth an abſolute Neceſſity upon us, that we take them, and uſe them. <hi>Work out your ſalvation,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>with fear and trembling; for it is God that worketh in you, both to will, and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2. 12. Our working is not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170109:43"/>
the cauſe of our ſalvation: but it is abſolutely neceſſary, that we work, if we will be ſaved: We cannot be ſaved, without our endeavour, though we are not ſaved for our endeavour. <hi>Qui creavit te ſine te, non ſervabit te ſine te. Paul</hi> had a promiſe, that both himſelf, and all that were with him in the ſhip, ſhould come ſafe to Land, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 23, 24, 25. but yet both he, and the reſt, muſt work for their own preſervation: and therefore when ſome of the Mariners were about to deſert the ſhip, he tels them, <hi>That except thoſe men ſtayed in the ſhip, they could not be ſaved,</hi> v. 30, 31. That of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 2. <hi>Except the Lord keep the City,</hi> &amp;c. is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable to this purpoſe. All humane endeavours are to no purpoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, unleſs God crown their endeavours with his bleſſing; and yet it's as true, that God will not effectually give his bleſſing, without the concurrence of humane endeavour. When Satan would have perſwaded our Saviour to have caſt himſelf down upon the Pinacle of the Temple, upon confidence of Divine Protection, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 5, 6. Our Saviour repels his temptation with this anſwer, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> It is not religious truſting, but preſumptuous tempting of God, for a man to think that God will preſerve him from deſtruction, though he neglect the means of his own ſafety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Souldier cannot think, that the Armour in the Magazine will defend
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170109:44"/>
him; it's the Armour upon the body that will preſerve him. A man may periſh at a full ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if he do not eat of that which is provided; and a Chriſtian may be overcome, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his Armour, if he do not uſe it, as <hi>God</hi> requires<hi>: Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it upon the boyl for a plaiſter, and he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,</hi> Eſa. 38. 21. A lump of figs would not immediatly have cured a Plague-ſore without a ſpeciall bleſſing; and yet if that playſter had not been apply'd, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had not recovered. God can work without meanes, and againſt meanes oftentimes; but he hath no where ſaid, that he will do ſo when Creatures neglect meanes afforded. If <hi>David</hi> had gone againſt <hi>Goliah</hi> without his ſling, he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned without victory. If the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> had neglected to encompaſs <hi>Jericho,</hi> they could not have expected the ſpoyl of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: their ſhouting was not the cauſe of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of the Walls of <hi>Jericho;</hi> and yet if they had not ſhouted, the walls had never fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; <hi>vid. Luk.</hi> 8. 35. Though Chriſt raiſed her by a Miracle, he would not preſerve her by a Miracle. A Chriſtian muſt uſe all lawfull meanes to accompliſh Gods Promiſes; and when he hath done, muſt wait for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Promiſe, as if nothing had been done.</p>
               <p>(5.) <hi>That the Ordinances of God, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, are not weak, but ſtrong things.</hi> This is gathered from the Notion of Armour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170109:44"/>
which theſe things are here repreſented: Armour hath ſtrength in it. The Apoſtle tels us, concerning the Ordinances, that they are <hi>mighty, through God,</hi> for the pulling down of ſtrong Holds, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. and the ſame Apoſtle tels us elſe-where, that the Goſpel in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like preaching thereof is <hi>the power of God to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 1. 16. And for the graces of God, they alſo have a mighty ſtrength in them. We read of the power of Faith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 11. Faith is a very powerful grace, it enableth the ſoul to do, and bear many things, which it could neither do, nor ſuffer, without this grace: it's that by which a Chriſtian obtaines victory over a mighty world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>Hope,</hi> another grace of the Spirit, hath great ſtrength in it: it is therefore called the <hi>Anchor of the ſoul,</hi> Heb. 6. 19. An <hi>Anchor</hi> is a ſtrong thing; by the ſtrength of the <hi>Anchor,</hi> the ſhip rides ſafe and ſtedfaſt in ſtormy and tempeſtuous raging weather. By the <hi>Anchor of Hope,</hi> the ſoul is kept ſtedfaſt in times of ſhaking and confuſion. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this difference between the ſtrength of the ſpiritual <hi>Armour,</hi> and material <hi>Armour.</hi> The ſtrength of other <hi>Armour,</hi> is not from him that wears it, nor from him that appoints it; but from the natural frame and contexture of it: but the ſtrength of the ſpirituall <hi>Armour</hi> is not from any thing naturally in it, but onely from the Inſtitution of him that hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170109:45"/>
the Weapons of our Warfare are mighty through <hi>God:</hi> of themſelves they are feeble, and very weak; but, through <hi>God,</hi> they become potent and mighty. If either Graces, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, ſhould be left to work by the force which is naturally in them, and ſhould not be ſtrengthened, and managed by a power from <hi>God,</hi> without themſelves, they would be no better then broken <hi>Armour:</hi> they would be but like bruiſed Reeds, quickly ſhaken to ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers by the leaſt wind of temptation: hereby weak Chriſtians have waxed valiant in battel, and turned to flight the armies of the <hi>Aliens, Heb.</hi> 11. 34.</p>
               <p>(6) <hi>That 'tis no wonder to ſee Satan ſo to prevail over graceleſs perſons by the power of his Temptations.</hi> The Apoſtle tels us, that the Devil worketh in the hearts of the children of diſobedience, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 2. A Child of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not one that ſometimes doth an act of Diſobedience, for ſo do the very Children of <hi>God.</hi> I find, that when I would do good, evill is preſent; and that the evill I would not, that I do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19. But a Son or Daughter of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, is the denomination of ſuch as make diſobedience their trade; ſuch a one as willingly fulfills the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind; as he is deſcribed, <hi>v.</hi> 3. one that is a ſervant unto ſin, <hi>That ſerveth divers luſts and pleaſures,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. In ſuch a one the Devil doth effectually and powerfully work<hi>:</hi> he is acted and moved by the Devil, as the body is by the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170109:45"/>
ſoul; and that not once, or now and then onely, but conſtantly, and continually, as the Particle <hi>(now)</hi> notes; it ſignifies a continued act. The ſoules, and minds, and conſciences, of ſuch men, are the ſhops in which Satan conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually workes, and that ſucceſsfully. And the ſame Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. ſpeaking of the ſame perſons, tels us, <hi>that they are taken captive by Satan at his will.</hi> If we conſider this text, we ſhall find it a thing not much to be admired at, for they have not the graces of the Spirit whereby they ſhould make effectual oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt his aſſaults: and therefore 'tis no wonder if they be vaſſalizd to do all the deſires of the Devils heart. A ſtrong King, with a multitude of men well appointed, may eaſily do his pleaſure upon a few naked and unarmed men; eſpecially, if they have no deſire to make reſiſtance: graceleſs perſons they have no mind to oppoſe the Devil: ſinne is as pleaſant to them, as it is to him; and if they had a mind to withſtand, yet they have no armes; and therefore, <hi>volentes nolentes,</hi> they muſt obey. If Satan tempt them to Blaſpheme, to Murther, to be Rebellious, to break holy Engagements, to ſubſcribe wicked Engagements; they want armour to withſtand, and therefore they muſt of neceſſity yield obedience.</p>
               <p>(7) <hi>'Tis no wonder to hear of Satans prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon thoſe perſons, and in thoſe places where the Ordinances are not planted.</hi> Some of the Heathens, they are contented to worſhip the

Devil as their God; and many in our own Land, in the dark corners of it, they are tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Sorcery, Witchcrafts, and to Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſuch Diabolicall Arts. This is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be much lamented, but 'tis certainly not much to be admired, unleſs it be, that it is no worſe; for they are deſtitute of that which is, and ſhould be for the defence againſt ſuch aſſaults; they are unwalled Villages, which lie open to the Devil at his pleaſure. The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, are a guard, to prevent the incurſions and invaſions of Satan; this guard they want: and therefore no wonder, if Hell be amongſt them. Where there is no Viſion, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> the People periſh, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 18. <hi>Piſcator</hi> reades it, <hi>Nudatur populus,</hi> the people is naked; and the word in <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifieth, as well to uncover, and make bare, as it doth <hi>ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare,</hi> or <hi>rebellis eſſe,</hi> or <hi>diſſipare,</hi> as others render it. The Ordinances of God are a very great part of a peoples defence; and if this defence be removed, or not erected, Satan muſt needs rage very furiouſly amongſt ſuch a People.</p>
               <p>(8) <hi>This let's us ſee why Satan is ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my both to the grace of God, and to the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God.</hi> That he is an enemy to grace, will appear from all the endeavour he uſeth, both to hinder the planting of it, where it is not; and to root it up, where it is planted and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Never did the Lord go about to work ſaving grace and converſion in the heart of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

but Satan uſed all his power and policy to hinder this Conception, either by himſelf immediatly, or by ſome of his Inſtruments. When <hi>Paul</hi> by the preaching of the Goſpel at <hi>Paphos,</hi> began to work ſome ſaving effect upon the Deputy <hi>Sergius Paulus, Elymas</hi> the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the Devils Inſtrument, labours by all meanes to turn him from the Faith, that he might not be converted, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 8. And when he cannot hinder the effecting of the work, he uſeth all meanes to deſtroy it, as ſoon as it is wrought. The Devil is like unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> if he cannot hinder the conception of grace in the heart at firſt, yet he will endeavour that the Manchild may be utterly deſtroyed, as ſoon as ever it is born.

And if he cannot hinder it from living, yet he doth what he can to keep it from thriving, by reproach, by perſecution, by quenching the motion of Gods Spirit, and all other wayes. And he is no leſs an enemy to the Ordinances of God, then he is to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God. When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prayer, a Spirit of Divination met them to take them off from that Duty, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 16. When <hi>Paul</hi> endeavoured to ſet up the Goſpel and the Ordinances at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> Satan ſtirs up the unbelieving Jews to raiſe perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the work might be hindred, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 5, 6, 7.</p>

And when he endeavoured to have come to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> afterwards Satan took him off, and hindred him once, and a ſecond time, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 18. Nothing doth he deſire to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw more earneſtly then the Ordinances: he knowes he can never ſet up his golden Calves, till he hath taken down the golden Candleſticks: The reaſon of his endeavors, is this; Theſe Graces and Ordinances are the ſoules Armour, by which he is hindred in his Temptations; and if he can but deſtroy this Armour, he knowes he ſhall invade the ſoul at his pleaſure, without diſturbance. When an enemy would be Maſter of a City, we know they take away that which may hinder them: they firſt ſeize upon the place of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, remove the Guards, and Gates, and Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Graces and Ordinances are the Ammunition of the Soul: when the Devil hath removed theſe, he hath nothing to oppoſe him: he may then come when he will, to rifle and plunder the ſoul. In order to the accompliſhment of this, it is, that he hath ſuch an aching tooth againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and Miniſters, that deſire to be firm and faithful; he knows, the Ordinances and they, muſt fall together: therefore he endeavours either to corrupt them; or if that cannot be, utterly to deſtroy them, that ſo he may rule and bear ſway without controll.</p>

(9.) <hi>What great Adverſaries are thoſe to themſelves, that have quite caſt off the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God?</hi> Amongſt many other ſoul-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Opinions which prevail in our licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious times, this is one, That the fulneſs of time is not yet come for Ordinances, That Ordinances are but fleſhly and carnall things, and that Chriſt is crucified in all theſe things to a Chriſtian, &amp;c. and hereupon ſome have quite laid them aſide. They will neither pray, nor hear, nor communicate in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but are above all theſe things. Theſe men have done the Devills work for him, they have diſarmed themſelves<hi>:</hi> and its juſt with God to leave them to the Devills cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to deal with them as he pleaſeth, that he ſhould hurry them into Atheiſme, profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all kinde of ungodly practices here; and into Hell hereafter.

               <p>(10.) <hi>How neceſſary it is for Chriſtians, to uſe all care for the proving of their graces, and for the ſtrengthening of their graces.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calles much upon us, to make tryall of the truth of our graces. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the faith or no, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. Graces are our Arms, and if our graces be counterfeit, Satan will ſoon pierce them in the day of temptation. To fight with falſe graces, is as dangerous, as to fight with paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Armour, inſtead of true Armour: never be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170109:48"/>
contented therefore, till you come to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge of the truth of every grace.</p>
               <p>And as its neceſſary to prove them, ſo its good to be ſtrengthening them againſt the day of aſſault. This God calls for as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Add to your faith vertue, and to your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue patience, &amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. 6, 7. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Growe in grace, &amp;c.</hi> Thinne Armour is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as unſerviceable as falſe Armour: a Sword without an edge will not be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a day of temptation, then a woodden Sword. Weak graces will make but weak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and not ſtrong offence neither, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally againſt ſuch an enemy as we have to do withall. (1.) Jeſus Chriſt hath received for Chriſtians, not onely variety of grace, but ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of every grace alſo. <hi>Of his fulneſs we have all received grace for grace, John</hi> 1. 16. one degree of grace after another. Now the ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of our union with Chriſt, will be the ſtrengthening of our graces: the further a Chriſtian gets into Chriſt, the more life and vigour will there be in his graces. (2.) The Ordinances of God are not onely for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of grace, but for the nouriſhing of grace; and though all Ordinances be not for converſion, yet all are for edification and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12.

men, if they have all other things anſwerable. Your labouring Chriſtians, will certainly be the ſtrongeſt Chriſtians: want of uſe ruſts your armour, and weakens it. VVant of uſe, makes ſtrong graces weak; but exerciſe and labour makes weak graces ſtrong, <hi>John</hi> 15. 2. Every branch in me that beareth fruit, he purgeth, that it may bring forth more fruit. To him that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance; but from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away, that which he ſeemeth to have. <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18. <hi>having</hi> is put for uſing, as the ſcope of the parable ſhews.</p>
               <p>11. <hi>What great cauſe we all have to magnifie Gods goodneſs, in continuing amongst us his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and in keeping the work of Grace ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in our hearts?</hi> That we have Armour to fight with againſt Satan, when very many lie open to his Incurſions, and have no defence. The Bulwarks of Gods Ordinances are demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and caſt down in many Churches, and there Satan rangeth at pleaſure; And we ſhall ſee cauſe to have our hearts inlarged the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to prayſe the Lord: if it be conſidered, what endeavours we have uſed to pluck theſe walls down with our own hands, by caſting much reproach upon them, and by being bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren under them, and by withdrawing our ſelves very much from them. And ſo for our graces, what means have we not uſed to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath and deveſt our own ſouls of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: We have neglected to fortifie and ſtrengthen them when they have been weak.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170109:49"/>
We have undermined them with our own hands, and gone about to heave them off with our own hands, and yet God keeps them on us ſtill.</p>
               <p>(12.) <hi>What a wicked thing is it, to endeavour to quench and kill the graces of God in the hearts of men?</hi> He that takes a ſtaffe out of the hand of a man, or Child, when a Lion is coming with open mouth upon him, would he not be guilty of his death? Grace is all the Armour a Child of God hath to defend himſelf againſt the aſſaults of that roaring Lion, and to ſeek to ſtrip him out of that Armour, is to make your ſelves guilty of all his ruine. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, He that taketh away a Garment in cold weather, is as he that ſingeth Songs to an heavy heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 20. The graces of God are as the Bladders, which keep us from ſinking in the Sea of Temptation: now to take away the bladders from a man ready to drown, is no ſmall cruelty, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170109:52"/>
ſoul that cannot be valued; And many, rather then not ſatisfie a ſinful Luſt, will ruine and deſtroy a glorious ſoul. What's the reaſon of this? The ſoul is, (1.) an inviſible Spirit; and becauſe it is not ſeen, many think it is not at all: or if it be, yet that it's little worth: The glory of the things of this World, is viſible to the eye of the body; but the glory of the ſoul is onely viſible to the eye of Faith. And (2.) the Caring for the Soul, is time enough to be thought upon when we are a dying, ſo many think, therefore they neglect all thought of it. Satan hath another opinion of it, then we have, elſe he would never ſweat and toyl, and multiply temptations, as we ſee he doth, to ſubdue it to himſelf.</p>
               <p>We may learn from hence, that a Child of God is never out of danger and fear of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, till all his work on earth be finiſhed. He cannot ſay when he riſes, I ſhal this day be free from temptation; and when he lyeth down in the evening, he cannot ſay, The evill one ſhall not aſſault me till the morning. He may ſay, through God, Satan ſhall not deſtroy me; but he cannot ſay, Satan ſhall not aſſault me. In other warres, when the forces of the enemy are all ſcattered, the Souldier may put off his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and ſay, This night ſhall be a night of reſt; the enemy that's now broken, cannot in a ſhort time be able to diſturb me: But the Chriſtian Souldier cannot ſay, When he hath ſcattered one of Satans temptations, Now my
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170109:52"/>
ſoul take thy eaſe, eat, drink, and be merry, thou art ſure of a weekes reſpite, &amp;c. Though thou haſt broken ſome of Satans forces; yet can'ſt thou not ſay upon any ground, I ſhall have a moments reſt. He can preſently recruit the old temptations: or if not, yet he can ſend out new temptations; and if thou take not heed, he will deſtroy thee by thy own victory. If thou overcome a temptation, to drive thee to deſpair, he can, out of that victory, make a temptation to bring thee to preſumption, if thou be not very cautious. Be watchful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and ſober, becauſe your Adverſary <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>goes about ſeeking to devour.</hi> Keep your guards continually, and keep them ſtrongly. Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Security, hath been the Pit-fall of many a ſoul. <hi>I ſaid in my proſperity, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be removed, &amp;c. thou didſt but turn thy face, and I was troubled,</hi> Pſal. 30. 6, 7. While men ſlept, the enemy came and ſowed tares, &amp;c. the Chriſtians ſleeping time, is the Devils Seed-time: if your Candle go out but one moment, that moment you may be ſurprized.</p>
               <p>Thus much for that which is implyed: That which is expreſſed, is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That though a Chriſtian be often aſſaulted, yet if he take and uſe the Armour of God aright, he ſhall overcome and keep the field when all aſſaults are over.</hi> He ſhall ſtand, when the Devil and all his Hoſts are deſtroyed and fallen: They may loſe the day for a time, and be ſo beaten and bruiſed, that in the thoughts both of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170109:53"/>
themſelves, and others, they ſhall never be able to recover; but at the laſt, their dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall riſe again, and then they ſhall obtain the final victory over Satan, and all his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I ſhall, firſt, prove that it is ſo: ſecondly, ſhew, By what meanes.</p>
               <p>That it is ſo, is proved three wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) This was prefigured and ſhadowed out by the Victories of the old Church over their enemies. I ſhall inſtance but in one, <hi>viz.</hi> the great victory over <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and his great Hoſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. I need not give you the Narrative of it: That this was a figure of the Victory which the Elect ſhall obtain over Satan, and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, is clear from <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. where we have the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lambe: Why the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and of the Lambe? But to point out this, that the overthrowing of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> was a figure of the overthrow of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: and the triumphal ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of that Song which the godly ſhould ſing in Heaven, for the overthrowing of Satan, and all his Inſtruments, whereby they have been ſadly aſſaulted in this world. As certainly, as <hi>Pharoah</hi> was overcome by the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo certainly ſhall every true Iſraelite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome this Helliſh <hi>Pharoah.</hi> Some alſo make the cutting off of <hi>Goliah's</hi> head, to be a figure of the ſame thing. As <hi>Goliah</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> ſo ſhall this great <hi>Goliah,</hi> the Devil, in all his aſſaults, be overcome by Jeſus Chriſt, and all the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:170109:53"/>
(2.) This is clearly laid down in many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>vid. Jam.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee.</hi> It is not onely a Prediction, but a Promiſe, He [ſhall] flee. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 20. <hi>The God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet, ſhortly.</hi> 'Tis Gods power that brings him down; but yet we are the Conquerors: He is bruiſed under [our] feet: ſo 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 18.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) We have glorious Examples, as well as Promiſes: <hi>Job</hi> was fearfully troubled with him, and ſometimes foiled by him. When he curſed the day of his birth, then did Satan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, but he overcame at laſt; and as a ſtout Champion, kept the field, till GOD himſelf came, and proclaimed him Conqueror. <hi>Paul</hi> was buffeted for a good ſpace; but he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came at laſt: You may hear him ſounding <hi>Victoria</hi> before his death, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. Satan is not able to ſhew one of the people of God over whom he did ever yet finally prevail, nor ever ſhall be able.</p>
               <p>II. By what means do they ſtand? Which are as the Reaſons of this Victory.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>They are upheld by a Divine Power.</hi> God is with them in the day of Temptation; and if God be with us, who can be againſt us? That which God promiſed <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, when he ſent him in his name to fight againſt a ſtubborn and refractory people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 19. He makes good to all ſuch as rightly uſe this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the day of Satans encounter. <hi>They ſhall fight againſt thee, but they ſhall not prevail</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:170109:54"/>
                  <hi>againſt thee: for I am with thee,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>to deliver thee.</hi> Satan is ſubject to the power of God, and muſt be ſubject. <hi>Hell and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are before the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15. 11. <hi>To be before the Lord,</hi> doth not onely denote, that all things are bare and naked to his eye; but alſo that all things are under his power and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Is not the whole Land before thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot? Gen.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>i. e.</hi> is it not in thy power to pitch and ſet down where thou pleaſeſt? Satan, and his Power, is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to God. He can with one word ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bring him upon his knees, and make him lick the duſt. <hi>I command thee, Come out of him, and enter no more into him for ever.</hi> All evill Spirits are in the hand of God, as well as good Spirits. The evill Spirit <hi>from God</hi> came upon <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 10. He is ſaid to come from <hi>God,</hi> becauſe he was ſet on, and reſtrained, and taken off by the Lord at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>They ſtand by the vertue of Chriſts death.</hi> The Devil was vanquiſhed by Chriſt, through his ſufferings: He triumphed over Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers upon the Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. By Death, he deſtroyed him that had the power of Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. Jeſus Chriſt cut off the head of this <hi>Goliah</hi> with his own Sword, as <hi>David,</hi> a Type of Chriſt, did before. Now all who fight aright with Gods Armour, draw vertue from Chriſts death, whereby they are ſure to prevail.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170109:54"/>
The Martyrs crowned in Heaven, are ſaid to overcome <hi>through the blood of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 12. 11. They overcame him, as an Accuſer, by the blood of Chriſt: Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is Chriſt that died, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. By applying this Blood, they put him to ſilence: And they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him as a Tempter alſo, by the Blood of the Lamb: By caſting this blood in his face, they put him to flight. <hi>Pharoah</hi> was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the red Sea; The Devil, in the red Sea of Chriſts blood.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>They have an intereſt in Chriſts exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and victory.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt overcame Satan as the Head of the Church Militant, not for himſelf alone, but for the whole body. As all Mankind were overcome in the overthrow the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> received in Paradiſe; ſo all the Elect do overcome in, and by the victory of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam.</hi> This is that which our Savior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth his Diſciples with, againſt the Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. <hi>Be of good cheer, I have over come the world,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>My Conqueſt is your Conqueſt; I have overcome not onely for my ſelf, but for you alſo.</hi> His Victory would have miniſtred no comfort to them, if they had not apprehended from his words, their joint-intereſt in it. And as they partake with him in his overthrow of the world, ſo do they ſhare with him in his overthrow of the Devil. And they are exalted with him in his Exaltation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:170109:55"/>
That of the Apoſtle, is full of comfort to this purpoſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6. <hi>God who is rich in mercy, &amp;c. hath quickned us together with Chriſt, and raiſed us up together, and made us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Chriſt muſt either deſcend from the Throne, or elſe we, as Conquerours with him, muſt aſcend to the Throne. Chriſt, and his Seed, are put as joynt-Conquerors into the firſt Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>It ſhall break thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel:</hi> As Chriſts Reſurrection, is by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle made the pledge of the Reſurrection of our bodies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20: ſo is the Victory and Exaltation of Chriſt, the Pledge and Earneſt both of our Victory and Coronation: And therefore he ſaith to the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Rev.</hi> 3. 21. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and am ſet down with my Father in his Throne.</hi> In Earthly Warres, all the Souldiers have a ſhare in the Victories of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief. Chriſt is the Commander in chief in the Lords Hoſt, and his Victories are not onely his, but the Churches alſo.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>They overcome by the ſtrength of Chriſts Interceſſion.</hi> I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith do not fail, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 32. Faith, and all other Graces, would ſoon be brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, did not Jeſus Chriſt make continual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation to ſtrengthen them. And the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances would prove but Paper-Armes, if the Prayer of Jeſus Chriſt did not mightily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170109:55"/>
them. This was figured clearly in that notable inſtance which is upon Record, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Amalek</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> were joyned in battel in <hi>Rephidim. Moſes</hi> while they were fighting, ſtood upon the Mount praying, and the iſſue was; While <hi>Moſes</hi> held up his hands, <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed. By this Example, <hi>God</hi> would, in a figure, have his people learn whence it is, that they ſtand againſt all Satans encounters; not by their own ſtrength, but by the holding up of the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the interceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt in the Holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. His hands are never heavy, neither is his heart heavy; he needs no ſupporters to ſtay up his hands, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did; he lives for ever, to make interceſſion.</p>

                  </note> of the ſalvation of the people of God. If any thing could deprive them of their Crown, it would be the prevalency of Satans Temptations, but he cannot prevail againſt them finally; they muſt ſtand, when he is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len. And upon this ground it is, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth ſo triumph in the aſſurance of his own glorification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39.</p>
               <p>(2.) We may from hence alſo take notice, that all the Defeatments and Overthrows, and Foyls, which any Chriſtian receives from the Devil, either immediatly aſſaulting, or aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his Inſtruments, are of, and from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: God hath furniſhed them with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Furniture, to enable them to with-ſtand

and overcome, and therefore if they be at any time overtaken and brought into bondage, they may blame their own negligence, they cannot accuſe their God.</p>
               <p>Exhortation. Let this put courage and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, <note place="margin">2. <hi>

                  </note> and reſolution, into the hearts of all Chriſtians, againſt the evill day. Keep your ground, hold faſt your Weapons in your hands; and though Satan beat you down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your knees, yet up again, and continue fighting, and you ſhall certainly overcome at laſt: nothing can hinder you from overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but either want of the right Armour, or elſe want of oppoſing. Certain knowledge of victory before hand would make a Coward valiant: you have a promiſe of certain victory, and therefore let not your hearts be faint. <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, when he was going to ruſh with his Horſe into the battel, he was earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſted to retreat, leſt by his miſhap the whole Army ſhould be diſcouraged; but he made this Heroick anſwer. <hi>An Emperor was never ſhot through with a Bullet.</hi> A Chriſtian may encourage himſelf againſt Satan, upon far better grounds. <hi>A Child of God was never ſhot to death by any Temptation of Satan, &amp;c.</hi> Its a marvellous encouragement in theſe black dayes of tryall. I do not think, that there was ever any age of the Church in which Satan had more ſtratagems and devices to draw the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God into ſin, then now he hath. He hath his Temptations of profit, and his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170109:56"/>
of loſſe: a Chriſtian cannot go into any Company, but ſome ſnare or other is laid for him, ſome Devill or other is ready to meet him. Well, do but reſiſt, and you ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The Devill cannot force you, he can do you no hurt, without your own conſent: and to conſent to an enemy, when you are ſure of victory, is neither wiſdom nor manhood.</p>
               <p>The three Children did bravely in the day of their temptation, they defied Satan and his Inſtruments, diſobeyed the Kings word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not ſerve nor worſhip any God, except their own God: neither the ſweet melody of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Muſick, nor the ready comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of others, nor the dreadful terror of the burning Furnace, could make them ſtoop, and by their valour they did overcome; and they obtained ſuch a perfect victory, that they had not ſo much as a skar upon them: The fire had no power over their bodies, nor was a hair of their head ſinged: neither were their Coats changed, nor the ſmell of fire had paſſed on them. You may read both the battel and Conqueſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>ad finem.</hi> Yea, their very enemies at laſt, proclaimed them Conquerours, and a glorious decree is made, that no God beſides their God, ſhould be worſhipped, and that it ſhould be preſent death for any within the Kings Dominions, to ſpeak the leaſt word againſt their God. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. 29.

               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> alſo, he did like a man of God, in the day of his Temptation, He was tempted to forbear praying for 30. dayes. It was a bare omiſſion, nothing was he compelled to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of God, onely to forbear holy invocation for a moneths time: he had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to pray in his heart, and to pray in a corner unſeen, he might have had 1000. things to have pretended for his omiſſion, He was a man of note, had a high place in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and was likely to riſe yet higher, if obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his God did not hinder his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was able to do great ſervices for the Church, by his Intereſt in the Kingdom, and would he now cut off himſelf, and prejudice the Church for ſo ſmall a matter? All theſe things and many more, no doubt, were ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him, by Satan and his Inſtruments; but <hi>Daniel</hi> like a man of courage, oppoſeth all theſe; and what the iſſue was, you may read <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. <hi>per totum.</hi> He beat the Devill in his own Den, by the help of Gods Angel; he clapt a muzzle upon the mouthes of the hungry Lions, lived to ſee the juſt hand of God upon his conſpirators, who had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170109:60"/>
I note this for theſe two Reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Chriſtians may ſee what uſe they may make of Natural and Earthly things:</hi> There is not any natural Action; there is not any kind of Employment, or Trade of Life; there is not any Creature, by which a Chriſtian might not learn ſome Spiritual Leſſon, did God but give him a Spiritual Heart. When thou ſeeſt the Merchant buſle about his buſineſs, then migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou learn diligence in the things of the Goſpel; <hi>For the Kingdome of Heaven is as a Merchant man,</hi> &amp;c. When thou ſeeſt the Souldier buckle on his Arms, and march with them to meet the enemy, then mighteſt thou think of the putting on, and uſing thy graces, &amp;c. And for this cauſe, it is that our Saviour did ſo frequently preach in Parables and Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, drawn from earthly things, that by this meanes the ſons of men might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to conceive of Heavenly Matters when they are thus delivered in their own way: And that they might have ever before them viſible Monitors to bring to their minds the things of God. Indeed, if theſe ſpirituall things had not firſt been revealed and taught in the Scriptures, the beholding of things Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural would never have taught us ſuch Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines; but being now made known in the written Word, our Memories, Underſtandings, and Affections, may be very much helped by the ſtudying and contemplation of things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural which ſet them forth.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:170109:60"/>
2. <hi>How neceſſary it is for the Miniſters of Chriſt, who are to interpret, open, and apply the Scriptures to men, to have an univerſal knowledge of all kind of Learning.</hi> Many think, that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Knowledge, and Learning, is of no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity to fit a man for the Miniſtry. If he have but knowledge in the Hiſtory of the Bible, and a gracious work upon his heart, he is ſufficiently enabled, without the knowledge of other Learning. This Text ſhewes us the contrary: ſome places of Scripture cannot be well interpreted, without the knowledge of Natural Philoſophy. Others cannot be rightly underſtood, without ſome skill in Aſtrology. Others, require the knowledge of Agriculture to expound them to profit. Others, of the Art of Navigation. Others, of Military Affaires. Similitudes, almoſt from all kinds of Arts, Sciences, Trades, are uſed in the Scriptures; and the more general a Miniſters Knowledge is in all theſe things, the better will he be inabled to interpret the whole Word of GOD in the courſe of his publike Miniſtry. He muſt ſtudy all kind of books. And make his Obſervation from all kind of employments of men, that he may be compleatly fitted for this great Work.</p>
               <p>But I come to the Particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The girdle of Truth: <hi>[Having your Loyns girt about with Truth.] In lumbis maxima vis eſt stantium. His malè affectis contrahitur corpus; aut certè vacillans, vel modicè impulſum,</hi>

                  <hi>corruit,</hi> Bullinger. Therefore, the Apoſtle begins with theſe, which he would have gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Truth. Truth, in the Scripture, is uſed to fet out two things: there is a two-fold Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is uſed for the Doctrine of Truth.</hi> That Doctrine which is held out and revealed to the ſons of men in the written Word; and thus <hi>Truth</hi> is oppoſed unto <hi>Errour.</hi> In this ſenſe it is uſed in many places? as, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>O fooliſh Galathians, who hath bewitched you that you ſhould not obey the truth?</hi> And, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>God will have all men ſaved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth.</hi> And 3. Ep. Joh. 4. <hi>I have no greater joy, then to hear that my children walk in the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is uſed for the grace of truth:</hi> And ſo it's oppoſed to Hypocriſie: In this ſenſe it's uſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 6. <hi>Thou deſireſt truth in the inward parts;</hi> that is ſincerity and integrity of heart: ſo <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 14. <hi>Fear the Lord, and ſerve him in ſincerity and truth;</hi> and ſo, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>God is a a ſpirit and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him inſpirit, and in truth.</hi> Spiritual Worſhip is there oppoſed to Ceremonial; and Truth of Worſhip is oppoſed to Hypocritical Worſhip. Now, amongſt Interpreters, there are ſome who expound this Text of <hi>the grace of truth:</hi> ſo doth <hi>Calvin,</hi> and others. Others, underſtand it, as ſpoken of <hi>the Doctrine of truth:</hi> Baldwin, <hi>vera Doctrina &amp; Religione,</hi> Zanchy. <hi>Constantia in Doctrina veritatis.</hi> Dickſon.</p>

1. Both Interpretations are agreeable to the Analogy of Faith.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Uſefull Inſtructions may be gathered from both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is nothing in the Text which doth neceſſarily limit and confine it to one; and therefore I ſhall refer it to both: for, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptura non diſtinguit, non eſt diſtinguendum.</hi> And ſo I ſhall lay before you a two-fold Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this two-fold Interpretation.</p>
               <p>1. Underſtanding it of the <hi>Doctrine of Truth,</hi> as ſome do, we note this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That firmneſs and ſtability in the Doctrine of</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Truth, is an excellent meanes to be preſerved, and to overcome Satan and his Inſtruments in the day of Temptation.</hi> I ſay, Firmneſs and Stability, becauſe the phraſe of <hi>being girded about,</hi> notes conſtancy and firmneſs in the Truth: When the Loyns are faſt tyed, and compaſſed about with this girdle, they are in a good way of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity from the aſſaults of Satan, when thoſe who forſake and fall from the Truth, are ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and overcome: then ſhall thoſe who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here and ſtick faſt to the Doctrine of Truth be delivered and eſcape. This is promiſed to the Angel of the Church in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> upon this very conſideration, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the word of my patience, I alſo will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:170109:62"/>
If a Church, or Perſon, be ſtedfaſt in the Doctrine of Truth, God will either keep them <hi>from temptation,</hi> or elſe he will preſerve them <hi>in temptation;</hi> that when others fall, they ſhall ſtand.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give you three Reaſons of this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Truth unites us to God, and God to us:</hi> It is of God, and hath a Divine Strength. God is truth; and ſo far as a perſon hath the truth, he hath God; and ſo farre as he loſeth the Truth, he loſeth God. 'Tis true, a perſon may have the Truth of God ſticking in his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: He may be very ſtedfaſt and conſtant in it; ſo that he may willingly part, not onely with his ſubſtance, but even with his life, to maintain it, and yet not be ſavingly united to God, by Chriſt, for ſalvation. 'Tis not the <hi>fides quae creditur,</hi> but the <hi>fides quâ creditur,</hi> which is the bond of this Union. But yet the very holding of the Doctrine of Truth, gives a perſon ſome kind of union with <hi>God;</hi> by which union, he is more able to ſtand when any ſtorm comes, then he that is deſtitute of the Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Truth helpes a Chriſtian both to diſcover a Temptation, and to anſwer Arguments uſed to ſet on the Temptation.</hi> The Truth of God, in the Judgment, is one of the Eyes of the Soul: he that wants this, is blind, and cannot ſee afar off. Now as a clear Eye is a very great help to the Souldier, for the diſcovering of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170109:62"/>
Dart, or the Bullet, before it be upon him: ſo is the clear diſtinct knowledg of the Truth a very great help to a Chriſtian, to diſcern the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before it be upon him. He is better able, by the power of Truth, to ſee the reach of Satan, and what it is that he drives at, when he ſpreads his ſnare to ſurprize him, then another can be, who hath loſt the Truth. Any fallacy is eaſily put upon a perſon that is deſtitute of the truth of an Art or Science; whereas he that hath the knowledge of that Art, is able preſently to avoid it, and to anſwer it. And therefore the Devil when he comes to tempt the woman to ſinne, firſt labours to blind her Underſtanding; <hi>Ye ſhall not die, but ye ſhall be</hi> as <hi>gods, knowing good and evill,</hi> Gen. 3. 4, 5. and when he hath ſtollen that principle of truth out of her judgment, <hi>We may not eat, leſt we die,</hi> He doth, without any difficulty, perſwade her to eat of the fruit.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Truth doth much help a Chriſtian in the managing of all other parts of his Armour aright.</hi> He that hath loſt the Doctrine of Truth, will be unable to uſe the Bread-Plate of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: For, to the uſing of this after a right manner it is requiſite, that the Doctrine of the Imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, to a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, be t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>roughly underſtood, and firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. The Helmet of Hope will ſoon be knocked off the head of a Chriſtian, if he do not well underſtand the Nature of the Grace Hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:170109:63"/>
The ſhield of faith will be preſently pierced by Satan, if he that weares it do not rightly underſtand the nature of faith: and prayer will do but little good, if he that makes the prayer be unſound in the truth. Prayer is to be made in faith, elſe it doth not prevail; it is to be made not only with the grace of faith, but alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doct: of faith. A Doctrinal errour in prayers, will nullifie them, as well as want of the grace of Faith; <hi>for this is the confidence we have in him, that if we aske any thing according to his will, he heareth us,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 14.</p>
               <p>Information. We may from this Doctrine <note place="margin">1. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
                  </note> gather theſe three concluſions, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>This ſhews us how neceſſary it is for a Chriſtian to have a clear and exact knowledge in the Myſteries of Truth.</hi> It is not in vain, that the Scripture doth ſo earneſtly call upon men, to learn, and to get, and to keep, the truth of Doctrine delivered in the Scriptures. <hi>Buy the truth and ſell it not,</hi> Prov. 23. 23. <hi>Stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our Epiſtle,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 15. not unwritten traditions, the Doctrines and Commandments of men, but ſuch as have been taught by the Apoſtles, either by word, or by their writings. <hi>Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the faith, quit you like men, be ſtrong,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 13. The word of God is full of ſuch warnings, and admonitions, as theſe are. And not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, whether we conſider the worth of truth in it ſelfe, or the uſefulneſs of it unto
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170109:63"/>
us. Its neceſſary to the ſoul in many reſpects: its the light by which we ſee our way, by which we know what to do, what not to do: its a great part of our ſpirituall Armour, by which we fight againſt temptations. Its as great a ſtrengthening to the Chriſtian, in fighting againſt Satan and his Inſtruments, as the Souldiers belt or girdle is to him in the day of battel. Take two Chriſtians of equall grace, and let them be aſſaulted with the ſame Temptation, and let the one be ſound in the Doctrine of Truth; and the other corrupt, and you will eaſily ſee the difference between the one and the other, by the iſſue of the temptation: the Doctrine of truth is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for fighting againſt Satan, as the grace of truth. I note this to let all of us ſee, what little reaſon any have to be diſpleaſed, either with the Miniſters of God, or other of the Servants of God, for their earneſtneſſe &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy, (if I may ſo ſpeak) in preſerving the truth of Doctrine, both among themſelves and others. They know the many advantages of it, and therefore they are ſo zealous for the maintaining of it. <hi>Paul</hi> though he was of as flexible and condeſcending a ſpirit as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether Apoſtle or ordinary Saint, in all other things (for he became all things to all men, that he might by all means ſave ſome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 19. 20, 21, 22.) yet he was ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and peremptory for the Doctrine of truth, that he would not give place by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170109:64"/>
to falſe Brethren for an houre, that the truth of the Goſpel might continue with the people of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) <hi>'Tis no wonder to ſee Satan uſe ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deprive the Sons of men of the Doctrine of truth.</hi> In all ages of the Church he hath raiſed up his Inſtruments to draw men aſide, from the truth of Doctrine. <hi>There ſhall be falſe Teachers,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>amongſt you, as there were falſe Prophets amongst the people,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. The Church of God, as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſtitute of true Prophets, ſo never was it without falſe Prophets. In the Church of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> there were a numerous Company of ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Prophets: As there was an <hi>Elijah,</hi> a holy and zealous Prophet of <hi>God,</hi> ſo there were 456. <hi>Prophets of Baal,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 22. The ſtate was corrupted, and they made to themſelves a corrupt Miniſtry of their own, an apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing State muſt have an apoſtatizing Clergy, that will humour them, and ſubſcribe to them in every thing they do: when Satan had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to ſet up golden Calves, he helped him to a Miniſtry that would worſhip them, and teach others to do the like. State Miniſters will cry up Calves for gods, rather then want promotion, or loſe preferment. And thus it was in the Goſpel Church. All <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles ſhew it. This ariſeth (1.) part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ſinfulneſs of men. They muſt have their luſts, and a luſt cannot thrive, if it have not a falſe Prophet to nurſe it, and give it ſuck.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170109:64"/>
And (2) partly from God, he in his wiſdom and juſtice permits it to be ſo, that they that would not obey the words of a true Prophet, ſhould follow the pernicious Doctrines of fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Prophets, 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 22. 23. And then (3) it comes to paſſe from the policy and malice of Satan, that he may by this means rob men of the truth, and ſo make them fit preys for his temptations. And we need not much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this policy, Satan knowes he is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being foiled, if he ſuffer this girdle to be upon the ſoul; and that he ſhall certainly overcome, if he can but pluck this off the loyns: therefore he is ſo diligent in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, laying ſnares to intrap the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, and opening a wide door for falſe Prophets and ſeducers to enter in, and corrupt the truth.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) <hi>We have no cauſe to wonder, to ſee the Devill ſo prevalent amongſt hereticall and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous perſons.</hi> Woful experience ſhews us, what deſolations are made by Satan in our corrupt Generation: what miſchievous wayes of iniquity many are led into. Many are drawn aſide, into great profaneneſſe of life<hi>:</hi> others are ſunk deep into rebellion, others are gone aſide into the way of perjury and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breaking, others into wayes of cruelty, perſecution and oppreſſion, others almoſt into groſſe Atheiſme: we may take up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> 59. 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:170109:65"/>
                  <hi>with iniquity; your lips have ſpoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverſeneſs: none calleth for juſtice, nor any pleadeth for truth, they truſt in vanity and ſpeak lies, they conceive miſchief, and bring forth iniquity, they hatch Cockatrice Eggs, and weave the Spiders Webs: he that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Eggs dyeth, and that which is cruſhed, breaketh out into a Viper: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. Their feet run to evill, and they make haſte to shed Innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, wasting and deſtruction are in their paths. The way of peace they know not, and there is no judgement in their goings: they have made them crooked paths, whoſoever goeth therein ſhall not know peace.</hi> A man would wonder to ſee and hear the horrible wickedneſſes that many are fallen into: ſome openly profane the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, others defile their Neighbours wife, and think they do not ſin in ſo doing. The cauſe of all theſe may be given in the words of the ſame Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> 59. 14. 15. <hi>Truth is fallen in the ſtreets, yea truth faileth.</hi> The Devil hath taken away from them this Girdle of Truth, and now they ſtop at no kind of abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Girdle of truth is quite looſed, and this doth ſo enervate and weaken them, that they are forced to do what ever the Devil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them. And can ye wonder at it? The loſſe of truth will certainly introduce all kinde of iniquity. And that both <hi>ex Natura Rei,</hi> and <hi>ex juſto Dei judicio.</hi> (1.) <hi>Ex Natura</hi>

(1.) <hi>Avoid the company and breath of known Seducers.</hi> They will either quite take away your girdle, or elſe they will much ſlacken it in a very ſhort time, if you have to do with them. <hi>If any man come to your houſe, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not, nor bid him, God ſpeed,</hi> 2 Joh. 9. 10. They have ſleight of hand, they can cut your purſes, while they look in your faces; <hi>from ſuch turn aſide,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Do not think meanly of ſuch Truths, as are of an inferiour Nature, and more remote from the Foundation.</hi> He that cuts off every day a ſmall ſhred from his girdle, will very ſoon ſnap it quite aſunder. Though every Truth be not fundamental, yet every Truth is a guard to the Foundation: the outer skin of an Apple lies remote from the heart; yet if you pluck that off, the very heart will be ſooner rotten. The finger is not a vital part; but a <hi>Gangrene</hi> in the finger, will (in a ſhort time) reach to the very Vitals, and corrupt the blood and ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Be much in prayer to him that keepeth both the hearts and the feet of his Saints, that he would keep the Truth in you, and you in the Truth.</hi>

                  <hi>Holy Father,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>keep through thine own Name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me,</hi> Joh. 17. 11. Let us often pray this Prayer of Chriſt; <hi>Holy Father, keep us through thy Holy Name. Tie on this girdle of Truth that it may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlip off, nor be taken off.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> puts

               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Take heed, as of all ſins, ſo eſpecially of the ſin of Pride.</hi> As Hereſie is the mother of pride and ſcornfulneſs; ſo Pride is the High-way to be Heretical. A proud perſon will ſoon be an erroneous perſon: <hi>If any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholeſome words, &amp;c. he is proud knowing nothing,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 6. 3, 4. Pride will make the Heart ſwell ſo bigge, that the Girdle of Truth about your Loyns, wil ſoon be knapt aſunder. Humility, and Watchfulneſs, are the beſt Buckles for this Girdle, and the way to preſerve Truth; but Pride and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe is the way to loſe it.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Keep a good Conſcience in all things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and towards Man.</hi> As the falling off from the Myſtery of Faith, will corrupt the Conſcience; ſo a corrupt Conſcience, and an ungodly Life, will, in time, deſtroy the Myſtery of Faith. There is this Reaſon for it: The Doctrine of godlineſs, reproves the Deeds of ungodlineſs: and therefore whoever goes on in ungodly Practices, will, at laſt, caſt off the Doctrine of godlineſs, that he may not be a Reprover to himſelf. Keep the Grace of Truth, that you may preſerve the Doctrine of Truth alſo. Thus for the firſt Interpretation.</p>

muſt have his Loyns girded about with Truth in the inward parts. He that wants this girdle, may ſtruggle, for a while, with a Temptation; and may, perhaps, overcome a particular temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but he can never hold againſt every temptation. Sooner or later, he wil be brought into bondage by the Temptations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. By the help of this Girdle it was, that Holy <hi>Job</hi> won and kept the field, and got the day of Satan, in that great Conflict and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute he had with him: And by this Girdle it was, that other of Gods aſſaulted ſervants did finally overcome.</p>
               <p>In the handling of this Doctrine, I ſhall do theſe three things:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. I ſhall briefly open the Nature of this Grace.</item>
                  <item>2. I ſhall give you the Reaſons of the Doctrine.</item>
                  <item>3. I ſhall lay down a Caution, or two, for the underſtanding of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. That we may find out what is meant by this Grace of Truth, I ſhall bring ſeveral Texts of Scripture which do explain it:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Partly by way of Oppoſition. And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Partly by Expoſition, or Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>1. By way of Oppoſition.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>We find it oppoſed to Deceitfulneſs, and Fraudulency, and Falſe-heartedneſs.</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>As Deceivers, and yet true.</hi> He is a man of truth;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170109:68"/>
that is, a man without deceit. Thus our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeakes of <hi>Nathanael,</hi> Jo. 1. 47. <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom is no guile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Iſraelite in truth, or a true Iſraelite, is one in whom guile and deceitfulneſs is not: he is one that hath not two faces; he will not juggle either with God, or men, or himſelf. Not, as if a man of truth might not ſometimes fall into an act of deceitfulneſs. <hi>Abraham</hi> had truth in the inward parts; and yet we know, once and a ſecond time, he fell into an act of groſs Diſſimulation: once in <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 12. 13. and a ſecond time at <hi>Gerar, Gen.</hi> 20. 2. But a man of Truth doth not allow or approve of any ſuch acts in himſelf; it is not his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; it is not his Cuſtome; he hath his converſation, in Integrity, &amp; godly Simplicity, as the Apoſtles ſpeak of themſelvs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. and therefore he cannot be called a guilefull man, or a falſe-hearted man, though he may do a guileful act.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>It is oppoſed to Pretence,</hi> Phil. 1. 18. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Falſe-Teachers, hath this expreſſion; <hi>Whether in pretence, or in truth, Chriſt is preached, and therein I rejoyce, and will rejoyce;</hi> Pretence, and Truth, are there oppoſed one againſt another. Now, a man of Truth, is ſuch a one, as is really what he pretends to be, whoſe inwards, and outward, are of the ſame alloy and complexion; when a man is Holy in Heart, as well as in outward appearance. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſome that did glory <hi>in</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170109:68"/>
                  <hi>appearance,</hi> but <hi>not in heart,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. Our Saviour chargeth the Scribes and Phariſees with this; <hi>Ye are like unto whited Sepulchres, which appear beautiful without, but inwardly are full of rottenneſs and putrifaction,</hi> Matth. 23. 27. When a man ſhall pretend to be a Saint, and act the part of a Devil: When a man, like <hi>Joab,</hi> ſhal pretend a friendly ſalute, <hi>Art thou in health my brother;</hi> and really intend to waſh his hands in his blood, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 9. When a man ſhall pretend, like <hi>Judas,</hi> to kiſs his Maſter, and intend onely to betray his Maſter: When men ſhall oppreſs, and devour widows houſes, and, for a pretence, make long prayers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 14. Such kind of perſons are utterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of this Grace of Truth; ſuch a one was that wicked <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nethaniah:</hi> of whom you read, <hi>Jer.</hi> 41. 6, 7. He goes forth to meet a company of ſad-hearted men, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to conduct them to <hi>Gedaliah</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but when he hath them in a ſnare, cuts their throats, and buries them in a Pit.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>It's oppoſed to Word and Tongue,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 18. <hi>My beloved let us not love in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed, and in Truth.</hi> When the Tongue and the Lips, are as different from the Heart and Actions, as the Jewes and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans, which have no Commerce one with another, this Grace of Truth is not in ſuch perſons. A man of truth is one whoſe hands and feet, act what his lips and tongue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170109:69"/>
The Prophet ſpeakes of ſome men that had an oily Lip, but a bloody Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 20, 21. He hath put forth his hands againſt ſuch as be at peace with him; he hath broken his Covenant. The words of his mouth were ſmoother then butter; but warre was in his heart. His words were ſofter then oyl, yet were they drawn ſwords: this was a very truthleſs man: ſuch men as theſe, we read of, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 15, 16. They had the language of the merciful man; <hi>Go in peace, and be warmed and filled:</hi> Here is Charity in the Tongue and Lip, but they gave nothing, either to feed, or refreſh him: this was not truth of Charity: ſo we may ſay of other Graces.</p>
               <p>2. By way of Expoſition, or Illuſtration; and ſo there are many ſynonymous words uſed to explain truth of Heart, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. It's explained by perfection, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 20. 3. <hi>I beſeech thee, ô Lord, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi> A true hearted Chriſtian, is a perfect hearted Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>There is a two-fold Perfection: The one is <hi>Legal:</hi> The other is <hi>Evangelical.</hi> The Legal Perfection is not to be found in any meer man, ſince the Apoſtacy of <hi>Adam.</hi> The Papiſts they diſpute not onely for the poſſibility of the attainment of this perfection; but they teach alſo that it is actually attained by many. But that's a meer Dream, and purpoſely held by them to maintain their wicked Doctrine
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170109:69"/>
of Merit and Supererogation; for the Scripture cleerly aſſerts the contrary; and the ſervants of God in the higheſt form, have utterly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed any ſuch thought. <hi>Job</hi> in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Job.</hi> 9. 20. <hi>If I juſtifie my ſelf, my mouth ſhall condemn me; if I ſay, I am perfect, it alſo ſhal prove me perverſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Paul,</hi> in the New Teſtament, though he might have ſtood upon his legal righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as much as any other, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 2. yet <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. he diſclaimes Perfection. Perfection of this kind is a thing to be much wiſhed for: but it is not attainable by any, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>The Evangelical Perfection is two-fold: the one, of Juſtification. And in this reſpect, every one who truly is in Chriſt, by ſaving Faith, is exactly perfect. <hi>Thou art all fair my Love, there is no ſpot in thee,</hi> Cant. 4. 7. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, by one offering, hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified.</hi> Heb. 10. 14. The other, is of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: And in this reſpect the truly-godly, are called perfect in three reſpects:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe they are ſo in part; there is in them a perfection of parts: they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed throughout in every Faculty of the Soul: the Underſtanding, Will, Conſcience, Affections, &amp;c. are all ſanctified truly, though not throughly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe they are in the progreſs of Perfection; it's that Mark they levell at, they will not ſit down without it: ſo <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:170109:70"/>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 14. I preſs towards the Mark, for the prize of the high-calling, &amp;c. this he cals Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Let as many as be perfect be thus minded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe they allow in themſelves none of their imperfections: Their ſmperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are their burthen, their ſorrow, their ſhame; they take no contentment or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them.</p>
               <p>2. It's explained by uprightneſs of heart: ſo ye have it, 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant</hi> David, <hi>my Father, great mercy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he walked before thee in truth, and in uprightneſs of heart, and in righteouſneſs.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of Heart, is a Heart without crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; a Heart that doth not bend and bow, this way, and that way, for gain, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſake. A ſwarving Heart, is oppoſed to an upright Heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. 4, 5. <hi>Do good, ô Lord, to thoſe that are good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As for ſuch as turn aſide unto their crooked wayes,</hi> &amp;c. A Heart of Truth, is a Heart that doth not warp to the right, nor to the left hand; he will not be ſwayed from his way, for fear of men, for hopes of preferment, for the avoiding of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward detriment and loſs. <hi>He is a man that lookes right on, and his eye-lids look ſtraight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; he doth not turn to the right hand, or to the left,</hi> Prov. 4. 25, 27, It's a metaphor, as ſome think, taken from the Plow-man; He hath his eyes not wandring this way, and that way, but he looks ſtraight before him, that he may
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170109:70"/>
make the furrow even: ſo doth a man of truth, he is fixed in his way and work, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is, that he may make an even furrow, that he may draw a ſtrait line, and keep himſelf in Gods way: let come on him, what will. Not, as if a Child of God might not warp from Gods way, they have their deviations. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> two great Apoſtles, they did not alwayes <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>vid. Gal.</hi> 2. 12. 13, 14. but then they do not continue in their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, they do not juſtifie their turnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, they do not compel others to turn aſide after them, or do ſay, that they have done well in ſo doing: They are not angry with ſuch as reprove them for their deviations. Neither <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſo much as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, much leſſe reviled <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he told them of their preſent deviations; but preſently reformed.</p>
               <p>3. Its expounded by Sincerity, and godly ſimplicity. So ye have it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. Therefore let us keep the feaſt, &amp;c. <hi>with the unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread of ſincerity and truth.</hi> Truth and ſincerity are all one, and ſincerity and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city are one and the ſame thing alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our Conſcience, that <hi>in ſimplicity and godly ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c.</hi> That which is ſincere is ſimple, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, like white wooll never died. <hi>Mel ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerum</hi> is honey unmingled, without wax: <hi>Fari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſincera</hi> is flower never leavened. A heart of truth is a heart uncompounded, a heart not
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170109:71"/>
double; a man of truth hath not a heart and a heart, one for God, and another for Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; one for ſin, and another for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: he hath but one tongue and one heart, he is ſingle tongued and ſingle minded, his tongue and heart go together as Companions. And (then) ſincerity notes ſoundneſs, a ſincere heart is a ſound heart: a heart not putrified with rottenneſs and hypocriſie. Though all men have hypocriſie in them, yet all men are not Hypocrites. Now take up all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they will declare fully what is meant by the grace of truth, with which the Apoſtle would have us to be girded. Not falſe heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not in pretence and appearance, not in word and tongue; but a perfect, an upright, a ſincere, uncompounded Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>2. For Caution, I ſhall lay down two Rules.</p>
               <p>(1.) Though truth be of ſuch uſe, &amp;c. yet may a ſincere and true hearted Chriſtian be foiled for a time, by ſome prevailing temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We are not to judge, either our ſelves or others, to be preſently hypocrites, becauſe we are ſurprized and overcome by a Temptation. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was a man of a perfect heart, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 20. 3. and yet he was vanquiſhed in battel in the day of temptation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 31. In the buiſneſs of the Embaſſadors of the Princes of <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp;c. God left him to try him, <hi>David</hi> was a man of an uncorrupt heart, God gives him that teſtimony, and yet in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170109:71"/>
of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> Satan overcame him. As a hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite and wicked man may ſtand out in ſome temptation, ſo may a ſingle hearted Chriſtian be overtaken and inſnared. Its true, they will recover themſelves again out of theſe ſnares, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>David</hi> did; but they may be for a time taken priſoners. <hi>Noah</hi> was a perfect man, and that in a perverſe and crooked Generation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 9. yet Satan ſurprized him, and drew him into the ſin of drunkenneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 21. Lot was an upright man in the ſink of Sodom, and yet he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by temptation, and drawn into the foul ſins of drunkenneſs and inceſt., <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 32, 33, 34, 35. We may ſoon take away ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the earth, if we make ſuch concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>(2.) Though truth be of ſuch uſe, &amp;c. yet no Chriſtian ſtands in the day of temptation for the merit of his ſincerity. Though no man have a promiſe of ſtanding without this grace of truth, yet is not any mans truth of heart the meritorious cauſe of his ſtanding. We ſtand <hi>by our</hi> ſincerity, but not <hi>for our</hi> ſincerity. As the Apoſtle concludes concerning faith. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. ſo we may conclude concerning upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We are kept by the power of God <hi>through ſincerity.</hi> Sincerity is the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſe, but the power of God is the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. This <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth in his temptation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 9. I will glory in my infirmities,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170109:72"/>
that the power of Chriſt may reſt upon me.</p>
               <p>III. The Reaſons of the Doctrine, how it is that truth of heart is ſo uſeful for this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe this is the ſtrength of all other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and of all Ordinances: Some Divines look upon ſincerity, not as a diſtinct grace, but as that which is the perfection of every grace. Truth of love is the perfection of love. Truth of faith is the perfection of faith. Truth of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is the perfection of obedience, &amp;c. All which is within a man without the grace of truth; is but like rotten wood, which will ſoon break, and never do any ſervice in the day of Battel. All which a man doth without ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is to no purpoſe. He can ſuck out no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from any of the Ordinances of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prayer, word, Sacraments, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Sincerity is that which engageth God to take our part in all temptations. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever integrity is, there God is by his ſpeciall grace, to aſſiſt and enable the ſoul. He ſtands far off from the rotten hearted Chriſtian; but his countenance doth behold the upright. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 7. That is an excellent place to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which we have in <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 5. 6. In the integrity of my heart, &amp;c. Yea I know thou didſt this in the integrity of thy heart, &amp;c. <hi>therefore ſuffered I thee not to touch her.</hi> We cannot ſay of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that he was a ſincere believer; for he was a profane King, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170109:72"/>
or truth of heart was but a meer mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall integrity, he would not have taken <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> had he known her to be the Wife of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man; and therefore he profeſſeth, what he had done, was done in the ſimplicity of his ſpirit, God bears him witneſs, that he ſpake the truth, and therefore ſaith God, I have kept thee, that thou haſt not touched her. God did ſo approve of that ſimplicity of his, that he preſerved him from falling into that great ſin, and delivered him from the Devills ſnare: if naturall and morall honeſty doth engage God to take part with a man, how much more will the grace of ſincerity engage him? <hi>James</hi> 4. 7, 8. <hi>Reſiſt the Devill and he ſhall fly. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Purifie your hearts ye double minded.</hi> The Apoſtle in that place would have Chriſtians to engage God on their part, in the day of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. There will be no prevailing, if God be not on our part. But how ſhall we obtain this aſſiſtance from God? he tells us, <hi>Purifie your hearts, ye double-minded.</hi> A ſingle-hearted Chriſtian ſhall not want, either the preſence or power of God, in the day of Battel. This is clear alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1. with 17. 1.</p>

                  <hi>whether they have this Grace of Truth in their hearts, or no.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt here puts great ſtreſs upon it, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in the firſt place. He is like to be quite undone in that day of temptation, that wants it. Every Chriſtian is willing to ſuppoſe that he hath it: therefore it's good to be at certainty about it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall for the helping of you, lay down theſe enſuing Rules, by way of Evidences <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>He that hath the Grace of Truth in his heart chuſeth the Word of Truth to be the Rule of all his Actions.</hi> He dares not make men his Rule, becauſe he knowes men of high degree are vanity; and men of low degree are a Lie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 9. He knowes wicked men are out of the way, and good men may miſs the way: and therefore he dares not walk according to men. <hi>Micajah</hi> would not ſay, Go up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper, though all the Prophets of <hi>Ahab</hi> had ſaid the ſame with one conſent. <hi>Whatſoever God puts into my mouth, that will I ſpeak,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 22. 14. This is that which <hi>David</hi> layes down, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 1. and this is that which he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170109:74"/>
in himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 30. <hi>I have choſen the way of truth, thy judgments have I laid before me.</hi> And as he dares not make men his Rule, ſo neither dare he make any outward Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of Providence his Rule. He is a man that adores Providence, and admires Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and reſts ſatisfied with all Acts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, and ſearcheth into Providence, but he dares not make it the Rule to walk by, the Glaſs to dreſs himſelf by.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He knows all things come alike to all; and that the worſt men, and worſt cauſes, have ſometimes good ſucceſs, at leaſt, for a long time. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He alſo knows, that the wayes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are very often like the way of a ſhip in the Sea, or of an Eagle in the Ayr; they are full of Riddles and Labyrinths, ſo that man cannot expound or trace them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He knows, that the actings and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Providence, are various; theſe wheeles do not alwayes keep the ſame track, therefore he dares not make them his Rule. The Word of Truth is viſible, certain, uniform, given for a Rule; and therefore this he chuſeth; from this he doth not willingly depart, <hi>vid. Pſal.</hi> 18. 21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>(3.) <hi>He that hath the Grace of Truth in his heart, uſeth true and warrantable meanes, for the accompliſhment of all his Actions.</hi> He doth not think it lawfull to paſs through all kind of formes that he may attain his deſires; he
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170109:74"/>
dares not put upon him any ſhape but one. Not but that a ſincere Chriſtian may be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by a Temptation, to uſe ſome meanes unjuſtifiable. <hi>Jacob,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah,</hi> both of them holy perſons, yet did uſe diſſimulation, to obtain the bleſſing from old <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 27. 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. But they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed for this ſinne: <hi>Jacob</hi> was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from his Fathers houſe, ſerved 20 years a hard Maſter, where he had wages changed ten times: and we do not read, that he and his mother ever ſaw one another upon earth. But though a child of God, whoſe heart is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, may fall into ſuch a practice, yet he dares not juſtifie any ſuch action. <hi>David</hi> durſt not take away the life of <hi>Saul,</hi> to come to the Crown, though he was anointed King by that God, who diſpoſeth of all kingdoms; he would not permit another to do it, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. yea, when an Amalekite came and told him, that he had ſlain <hi>Saul,</hi> and that by his own deſire, when he was full of anguiſh, and could not have lived many hours, <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to be put to death for that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked act, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15. He that hath truth of heart, knowes well, that God hath forbid him to do evil, that good may come thereby, and that he muſt not lie for God, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 7, 8. He will not chuſe ſinne, to eſcape affliction. <hi>Elihu</hi> chargeth <hi>Job</hi> with this, and uſeth it as an Argument to prove him unſincere, <hi>Job</hi> 36. 21. A true-hearted man knowes that God hath
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170109:75"/>
preſcribed meanes, and lookes at them as much as ends; and yet wicked means diſcredit and condemn the beſt ends: <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. there was a very good end, &amp;c. not fighting without ſeeking Gods face, &amp;c. So 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 15, 16, 21, 22. This was a good end, to ſacrifice to God of the ſpoyl of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp;c. but the meanes were nought: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD abhorres it, as an act of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>He that hath truth of heart, doth all his Actions to a good end.</hi> His aymes are ſincere, and incorrupt; at leaſt, he deſires they may be ſo, and is much troubled that they are not ſo. He knowes that a good Action is diſcredited, if he that doth it have not a good end, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 2. <hi>Jehu</hi> failed in this, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 10. He did very many good things, put all the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> to death, &amp;c, deſtroyed <hi>Baal</hi> out of <hi>Iſrael, ver.</hi> 28. God teſtifies for him that he had done, that which was in his heart, <hi>ver.</hi> 38. unto the houſe of <hi>Ahab:</hi> But all theſe things were done for baſe ends, to eſtabliſh himſelf in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: therefore, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 4. God threatens to avenge the blood of <hi>Jezreel</hi> on the houſe of <hi>Jehu.</hi> Our Saviour makes this a diſtinguiſhing Evidence between a painted Hypocrite, and a real Saint, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. They may give as many, and as great Almes; They may give God as many, and as long Prayers, as a ſincere Chriſtian doth; but they differ in their ends. The end of the one, is to get glory from men,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170109:75"/>
to ſatisfie the voyce of Conſcience, &amp;c. The end of the other, is to approve his Heart to God, to glorifie his Heavenly Father, and to teſtifie his Obedience to the Command of God.</p>
               <p>(4.) <hi>He that hath the Grace of Truth in his heart, is the ſame in private, that he is in publike.</hi> The Lining, and the Out-ſide of his garment, are both of one piece; he is clean within, as wel as without: a ſpot upon his skin, is as great a trouble to him, as a ſtain upon his garment. This is that, which our Saviour makes a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing <hi>Note</hi> between a Hypocrite, and a ſincere Chriſtian, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 7, 8. the Hypocrite is onely for the out-ſide of Cup or Platter, that that may be clean; but the inward part is full of wickedneſs. This is <hi>David</hi>'s Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>I was alſo uncorrupt before him, and kept my ſelf from mine iniquity; i. e.</hi> from ſecret ſinnes, as well as publike. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 2. <hi>I will walk in the midſt of my houſe with a perfect heart.</hi> A ſincere Chriſtian is as good in his own houſe, as in Gods houſe; in the Cloſet, as well as in the Streets; in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Chamber, as well as in the Church. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to have a clean heart, as well as clean hands, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, purifie your hearts, ye double-minded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(5.) He that hath truth, will be the ſame in trouble, and after trouble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 34, 35, 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:170109:76"/>
Exhortation: That all that profeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, would both carefully get and keep this girdle of Truth.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here urge it by ſome Motives; and then lay down ſome Helpes and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>1. For Motives.</head>
                  <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Sincerity is the beſt ſecurity,</hi> Prov. 10. 9. <hi>He tbat walketh uprightly, walketh ſurely; but he that perverteth his wayes, ſhall be known:</hi> God knowes him already, and men ſhall know him, when the Mask of Hypocriſie is pull'd off his face: his rough garment which he wore to deceive, ſhall in due time be plucked off, and then his deceit ſhall be made manifeſt. He walkes under Divine Protection; he walkes under the ſhadow of Divine Promiſes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is in ſafety. He may ſometimes come into danger; but he ſhall be delivered either <hi>in</hi> danger, or <hi>from</hi> danger, or <hi>by</hi> danger: Yea, ſometimes God brings him into a leſſer dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to preſerve him from a greater, <hi>vid. Jer.</hi> 38. 38. His impriſonment ſaved him from the danger he might have been in by the enemy, when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken. The three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. were preſerved by their Integrity. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> never was in ſuch danger, as when he warped a little, and went into the Land of the Philiſtins: He got a ſtrong Hold of <hi>Zicklag,</hi> from the King of <hi>Gath;</hi> but that Fort was deſtroyed and he was never in ſuch diſtreſs in all his troubles, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:170109:76"/>
30. <hi>init.</hi> His own guard had there been his Executioners, had not God, by a mighty hand, ſtaved them off.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Integrity of Heart, is the beſt Guide in ſtraits, and doubtful Caſes.</hi> This is promiſed. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 3. The integrity of the Upright ſhall guide them; but the perverſneſs of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors ſhall deſtroy them. It's a marvellous happineſs to have a perfect and faithfull guide in dark and dangerous Travels. It's a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge belonging to the godly man, to have Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine guidance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 8. He that is ſincere, ſhall have this guidance. It is evinced by what hath been ſaid: Integrity makes the Word his Rule: And that Word is a Lantern; yea, 'tis a Light ſhining in a dark place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. and he that followeth this Light, ſhall ſee his way, when others are in obſcurity: <hi>vid. Iſa.</hi> 30. 21. The Spirit of God, who is the Soules guide, dwels in a ſincere heart, therefore he ſhall be led in the right path.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Sincerity of heart will procure Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of all your ſervices.</hi> Though they be very weak, and very imperfect, yet if they be ſeaſoned with the Salt of ſincerity, they ſhall not be caſt away, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. The Sacrifice of the Wicked, is abomination to the Lord; but the Prayer of the Upright, is his delight. It's a marvellous comfort to a Child of <hi>God,</hi> that his Duties find acceptance: When they do but ſuppoſe that their ſervices are rejected, how are they caſt down? how are they diſquieted?
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170109:77"/>
Nothing can ſatisfie them in ſuch a Caſe. Well! if your hearts be ſincere, your prayers ſhall be as Incenſe, and ſweet Odours, in the ſight of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) <hi>The Services and Ordinances of God ſhall convey ſtrength to you.</hi> When the falſe-hearted Chriſtian ſhall winder and molder away, and all which he ſeemed to have, ſhall come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; then ſhall the true hearted-Chriſtian be as one anointed with freſh Oyl, he ſhall be active, vigorous, and ſtrong, This is promiſed in many places, <hi>Job</hi> 17. 9. The Upright ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands ſhall add to ſtrength. The meat and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is taken by a man, whoſe vitals are conſumed, gives no true ſtrength to him: He may, perhaps, for a little time, appear to be fat, and in good liking, but all his growth is but wind and emptineſs, which in a fit of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will ſoon waſh off: But the meat of a man that is ſound, turnes into nouriſhment, and makes him grow: ſo it is with the Soul, the rotten Hypocrite he gets no nouriſhment by the Ordinances; but the ſound Chriſtian gets ſtrength by them. He may not preſently perceive his growth nor does he grow always alike in all graces; but in ſome grace or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he increaſeth, and ſhall increaſe his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſtrength, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>The way of the Lord is ſtrength to the upright; but deſtruction ſhall be to the workers of iniquity.</hi>

(5.) <hi>God will pardon, and graciouſly paſs by many failings and infirmities, if the heart be ſound.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 12, 13, 14. King <hi>Aſa</hi> was guilty in many things: there were very viſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects found in him, contrary to that which the Law of God required. He took away the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites which were in the Land; he removed all the Idols which his Fore-fathers had made; He depoſed his Mother from her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, becauſe ſhe had made an Idol in a Grove, but the high places remained ſtill: <hi>Nevertheleſs, the heart of</hi> Aſa <hi>was perfect with the Lord all his dayes:</hi> And becauſe he was a man of a ſound heart, God accepted what he had done well, and graciouſly pardoned his Omiſſions. And therefore it is, that <hi>David</hi> makes the ſoundneſs of his heart an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to move God to forgive his ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 6. <hi>Behold thou requireſt truth in the inward parts,</hi> that is to ſay. Lord, although according unto the letter of the Law, thou haſt cauſe to caſt me off, yet according to the tenour of the Goſpel, I hope thou wilt pardon me, for thou knoweſt my heart is right in thy ſight: and, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7, 8. he prayes, that God would judge him according to his integrity, and according to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs that was in him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>This Grace of Truth is the way to have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and communion with God.</hi> Hypocriſie, and falſe-heartedneſs, is a bar in the way of our
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170109:78"/>
Communion; God will not ſhew his face with joy unto ſuch, whoſe hearts are rotten. Hypocrites may tell you of much Communion they have with God, and of great joyes they find in their ſpirits: but this their joy is but like a Land-flood, it is quickly dryed up again; a few Sun-ſhine dayes ſokes-in all this joy: It is, indeed, but a falſe joy which comes from Satan, transformed into an Angel of Light, and it ſhall be but for a moment. <hi>Job</hi> tels us, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 6. that <hi>a hypocrite ſhall not come before him.</hi> He ſhall not ſee the face of God with any joy. No, no, Communion with God is onely promiſed to ſincerity, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Draw nigh to God &amp;c. Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, purifie your hearts ye double minded.</hi> And therefore <hi>David,</hi> upon the profeſſion of this integrity, calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for his preſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101. 2. <hi>O when wilt thou come unto me: I will walk in the midſt of my houſe with a perfect heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Integrity is the way to dant all your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> To warp from the wayes of God, will much encourage your adverſaries; it will make them more bold, and more violent: but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and holding on in your integrity, will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in due time, make your hearts fail. <hi>Herod</hi> was afraid of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> becauſe he was a ſincere man, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 20. And it's ſaid of <hi>Saul,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>David</hi> behaved himſelf wiſely, he was afraid of him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 15.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Sincerity of Heart will be a ſtrengthning Cordial to your ſoules, in the day of affliction
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170109:78"/>
and trouble. Integrity is the beſt way to keep you from trouble, and to deliver you out of trouble: but if at any time ye do fall, and lie under trouble, Integrity will be a ſoft Pillow to reſt your heads upon, in the evil day: <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>This is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> &amp;c. This was that which made the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs ſo joyful in Priſon: This was that which kept up the heart of <hi>Job</hi> in his great ſufferings; and this made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſing with ſo much joy, when their feet were faſt in the ſtocks, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Integrity will make the end of your life peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> You may have Contentions and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and unquietneſs in the way<hi>:</hi> but you ſhall be ſure to find calmneſs, and ſerenity, and peace, in the end. This is promiſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 37. Mark the upright man, &amp;c. <hi>for the end of that man is peace.</hi> The beginning, and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Hypocrite, may be in ſome kind of tranquillity; but the end will be a ſtorm. <hi>Job</hi> had many a ſore ſtorm; but his latter end was peaceable and ſerene: That's well, that ends well: the Hypocrites portion is to lye down in ſorrow, <hi>Eſa</hi> 50. 10, 11.

               <p>THeſe words contain the ſecond piece of the ſpirituall Armour. And this is fitly added to the former, <hi>having your loins girt about with truth. In lumbis maxima vis eſt ſtantium.</hi> If the loyns be infirm, the whole man is full of trembling, and with the leaſt violence preſently falls to the ground. Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and ſincerity ſtrengthen the loyns, and make the body ſtable. <hi>Deme Chriſtiano verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; corruet protinus. Bullinger in locum.</hi> Now the breaſt is as neceſſary for our ſure ſtanding, as the loyns: though the loyns be girded, yet if the breaſt be open to violence, the party comes ſuddenly to the ground. All the vitall parts, the heart, liver, lungs, &amp;c. are in the breaſt; and if thoſe be not carefully ſecured, and preſerved, death and falling doth ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enſue. A little wound in the breaſt is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and incurable. Therefore the Apoſtle would have his Souldier to make careful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for that part, he muſt be as careful to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170109:80"/>
put on his <hi>Breaſt-plate,</hi> as his <hi>Girdle.</hi>

That which is brought to ſet out this piece of Armour, is the grace of Righteouſneſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That we may underſtand his meaning, we are to conſider the Accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this word in the Scriptures. Now there is a twofold Righteouſneſs, The one <hi>Legall,</hi> the other <hi>Evangelicall.</hi> Legall Righteouſneſs is a perfect, compleat, ſtrict conformity to the Law of God in every thing. This righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not that which is meant in this place; for there is not one (meer) man in this world, who ever did, or ever ſhall wear this Breaſt-plate, ſince the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> He indeed had this Armour put upon him in his Creation; but he and we in him loſt it by the fall, and ſhall never be able to recover it again. <hi>God looked down from Heaven, upon the Children of men, &amp;c. but they are all gone out of the way, there is none righteous, no not one.</hi> Evangelicall
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170109:81"/>
Righteouſneſs is that which is interpreted ſo in the Goſpel, a qualified righteouſneſs. Now this righteouſneſs of the Goſpel is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. A righteouſneſs of imputation or juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by vertue of which, a perſon ſtands righteous, and unſpotted before God: this is nothing elſe but the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, imputed or reckoned unto a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinner, whereby he is conſtituted righteous in <hi>foro Dei.</hi> This is called in Scripture, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> becauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God, contrived of God, imputed by God, ſometimes <hi>The Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> becauſe its applied, received, and put on by Faith, as a hand or Inſtrument appointed for that purpoſe. Somet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mes the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, becauſe its wrought by Jeſus Chriſt for us. This Divines Call, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of our Perſon, A Righteouſneſs without us, A Righteouſneſs communicated to us, A Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs upon us, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. A Righteouſneſs of Sanctification, by which we work righteouſneſs. This is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. Habituall, which is nothing elſe but the new nature, or new man created, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the heart of a Chriſtian, at the time of his new birth, or Regeneration, called by Divines, <hi>Inherent righteouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us.</hi> Of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs, and true holineſs;</hi> and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170109:81"/>
of this alſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 9. <hi>his ſeed abideth in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Actuall, which is nothing elſe but the manifeſtation and exerciſe of the work of righteouſneſs in a holy and unblameable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation towards God and Man in our thoughts, ſpeeches, actions. This is called the working of righteouſneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 35. the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 7. <hi>he that doth righteouſneſs is righteous, as he is righteous.</hi> This is called by Divines, <hi>A Righteouſneſs from us, The Righteouſneſs of our courſe or Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Sometimes this Righteouſneſs is joyned with holineſs. And then <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> ſtrictly refers to the Duties of the ſecond Table, and <hi>holineſs</hi> to the Duties of the firſt Table, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 75. ſometimes it is put alone, and then it comprehends all Duties to God and man, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6. its ſaid of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth, that they were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandements and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lord, blameleſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are ſome Expoſitors, which by the Breaſt-plate of righteouſneſs, underſtand the righteouſneſs of Imputation, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt imputed by faith, for our ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. But this I ſuppoſe, is not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle here, becauſe he doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpeak particularly of the ſhield of Faith, verſe 16. under which this righteouſneſs of Faith is comprehended. Others by the Breaſt-plate of righteouſneſs, underſtand only
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170109:82"/>
this laſt, <hi>viz. righteouſneſs of converſation,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameableneſs, and innocency of life, ſo <hi>Calv. Zanch. Deodat, Bulling. Piſcator,</hi> and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the whole Current of Interpreters. And this is moſt likely to be his meaning, if we conſider what goes before, <hi>viz. the Girdle of Truth,</hi> he firſt commends unto them, inward ſincerity, or truth of heart, and then that which is alwayes an effect or conſequence thereof, <hi>holineſs of converſation.</hi> Taking this to be the meaning of it, the Doctrine is this.</p>
               <p>That holineſs and righteouſneſs of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, <note place="margin">Doct.</note> is of excellent and neceſſary uſe for him that would ſtand, and overcome Satan in the day of temptation. The Breaſt-plate of a righteous life is neceſſary to be put on, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by every Chriſtian Souldier, that would be victorious in the day of ſpirituall Aſſaults. In the opening of this Doctrine, I ſhall clear theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wherein righteouſneſs of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſts: what are the characters of a righteous man?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wherein the uſefulneſs of it lieth, as to the withſtanding and overcoming in the day of Temptation.</p>
               <p>1. Righteouſneſs of Converſation takes in theſe two things, which may be as Evidences and Tryalls.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>He that deſires univerſally to obey all the Commands of the firſt and ſecond Table.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170109:82"/>
unto all the Commandments of God is that which in the Language of Scripture doth denominate a perſon truly righteous. Not that there is any man on earth, that perfectly fulfills the Law of God, <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from ſin? Prov.</hi> 20. 9. If any man ſhould dare to affirm this, the Holy Ghoſt tells him he is a lyar, and a ſelf-deceiver, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. But yet there are many, who do truly endeavour to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the whole will of God; and theſe are in a qualified interpretation, righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. This is that which the Apoſtle teſtifieth of himſelf, before the Governour <hi>Felix, Acts</hi> 24. 16. Herein do I exerciſe my ſelfe to have alwayes a Conſcience void of offence, <hi>towards God and towards man.</hi> There are ſome who are careful of the Commands of the ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they would have a good Conſcience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men; they would not cheat, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud, they would pay every man his own, they are morally righteous; but they take no great care of the duties of the firſt Table, they are willingly unrighteous towards God, at leaſt in ſome duties, make no conſcience of prayer (publique, private, ſecret,) are not exact about the Sabbath, &amp;c. theſe are unrighteous perſons, they defraud God of his right. Others are ſeemingly righteous towards God, but they are willingly wanting, and defective, in that which concerns man, at leaſt in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: theſe are as far from righteouſneſs, as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170109:83"/>
the other. <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Eliz.</hi> are ſaid to walk <hi>in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord,</hi> blameleſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6. They were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion blame-worthy in many things; but they did not willingly neglect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny known duty; they did not ſay unto any Command of God, <hi>ſtand by,</hi> but did deſire to obey <hi>univerſally.</hi> True holineſs ſaith not as <hi>Naaman.</hi> In this thing the Lord pardon thy Servant, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 5. 18. but ſaith with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Concerning thy precepts, I account them in all things to be juſt, <hi>and therefore I hate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very falſe way, Pſal.</hi> 119. 128. little duties as well as great, ſmall lies, meer omiſſions, &amp;c. It is not one action which denominates a man righteous; but univerſality of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. God gives this commendation to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb,</hi> the Son of <hi>Jephunneth,</hi> that he wholly followed the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 36. and <hi>Moſes</hi> gives the ſame teſtimony to <hi>Joſhuah, Joſh.</hi> 14. 9. A righteous perſon knowes, (1) That there is the ſame purity in all Gods Commands. And (2) that there is the ſame obligation for every Command. He that ſaith, do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, ſaith alſo, Do not kill, &amp;c. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 10, 11. And (3.) that one ſin allowed, will ruine and ſink his ſoul, and diſturb his peace, as well as many. And (4.) he hates ſin as ſin, and he loves obedience as obedience, and therefore applies himſelf to all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:170109:83"/>
(2.) <hi>He that lives a righteous life, doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially bewail every Act of unrighteouſneſe.</hi> His ſin is his ſorrow and burden, and his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is wounded for the leaſt iniquity, not onely that which is known to men, but even that which is known to God onely: his ſecret wandrings produce both ſecret and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen grief. Its ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> that his heart ſmote him, for the cutting off of the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> Garment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. the ſame is ſaid of him, for the number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the people. Neither of theſe were ſins of any high or ſcandalous nature, and yet they occaſioned great trouble to <hi>Davids</hi> ſoul. Yea, true holineſs doth much lament the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſin, that dwells within him, though it do not break forth into actuall exorbitancies. Thus it was with <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 23. 24. <hi>I ſee a Law in my members, &amp;c. O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me, &amp;c.</hi> yea and ſecret ſins, as well as known ſins. And all this ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the heart of a righteous perſon, is not <hi>onely,</hi> or <hi>principally,</hi> for the miſchief ſin hath or may work unto himſelf here, or hereafter; but chiefly out of that Antipathy which is in his heart againſt ſin, and out of reſpect to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, who is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and wronged by his ſin. An unrighteous perſon caſts his ſins behinde his back, never remembers them, unleſs it be with ſenſuall delight, or at moſt, legal ſorrow, and that not ſo much for hatred of ſin, as fear of Hell; but
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170109:84"/>
a truly righteous perſon ſets them continually before his face. And that not onely before, but after pardon. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 3. and yet <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> had told him before, that <hi>God had put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his ſin, he ſhould not die,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. And ſo, <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>He that is of a righteous life is as careful to abſtain from appearances of evill, as from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and direct evill.</hi> He dares not touch any thing that looks ſin-like, or that hath the leaſt affinity with it. If any thing be propounded to him, which hath the face of vice, he dares not for all the world, have any thing to do with it, he will not eat ſwines fleſh, or drink the broth, <hi>Iſay</hi> 64. 4. If the thing be doubtful, whether it may or may not be done, he will do that which is moſt ſafe, and leave it undon. Any thing which may be juſtly an occaſion of ſin to others. Any thing which may have ſinful conſequences: Any thing which may be liable to miſconſtruction. Any thing which may prove detrimentall to others. Any thing which may ſtrengthen, confirm, and ſettle wicked men in ſin, though the thing ſhould not perhaps be a ſin in it ſelfe<hi>:</hi> yet he that hath the Breaſt-plate of righteouſneſs, dares not do it, becauſe it hath the appearance of ſin. Any thing that is of evill report. It was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for <hi>Paul</hi> to eat fleſh, (whatſoever is ſold in the Shambles, that eat, asking no queſtion for Conſcience ſake: (yet, when that action might have an appearance of evill, and be a ſcandall
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170109:84"/>
to others, he reſolves not to do it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Paul</hi> might as lawfully have circumciſed <hi>Titus</hi> as he did <hi>Timothy;</hi> but when he foreſaw, that it would have produced an evill conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> it would have confirmed the Jews, in the errour of the Circumciſion, he would not do it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 3, 4 Holy <hi>Daniel,</hi> Cap. 1. 8. would not eat of the Kings meat, nor drink of his wine: there was an appearance of evill: he did not know but ſomething might be in it, which was uncleane to a Jew by the Law; or ſomething which had been conſecrated to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolls. <hi>Tertullian</hi> will have no lights in the worſhip of God, becauſe <hi>mos erat haereticorum,</hi> Heretiques uſed ſo to do. 1. A righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath an Antipathy againſt ſin, and this makes his heart riſe againſt any thing that is but like it. 2. A righteous perſon is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſubtlety of the Devil, and the incroaching nature of ſin, he that gives way to the appearances of ſin, will in a ſhort time yield to that which is apparently evil.</p>

He deſires not onely to bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſs, but to be filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, and to abound more and more: he doth deſire daily <hi>to put off the old man, and to put on the new man, which (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God) is created in righteouſneſs and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 22, 24.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſeeth the vileneſs and odiouſneſs of ſinne, and therefore would have it further
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170109:87"/>
mortified: he ſeeth the excellency and beauty of holineſs, and therefore he would have it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: and, to this purpoſe, deſires to make conſcionable uſe of all meanes of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Renovation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſeeth what a little meaſure of holineſs it is, which he hath yet attained unto, and this makes him mend his pace.</p>
               <p>(5.) <hi>The righteous man is one who workes righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in all times.</hi> Not onely when it is gainful, but even then when it is dangerous and prejudicial. This is <hi>David</hi>'s character of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 20. <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He can diſtinguiſh between <hi>fas</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fas,</hi> when the generation, wherein he lives, is wholly devoted to wickedneſs. This is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Noahs</hi> righteouſneſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 1. You have a deſcription of that Generation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 5. In this Generation <hi>Noah</hi> kept his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>This the Apoſtle exhorts the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Phil. 2. 15. That ye may be <hi>harmleſs and blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the middeſt of a crooked and perverſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>

Yea, a righteous man in ſuch a generation, by a ſpiritual kind of <hi>Antiperiſtaſis,</hi> endeavors to walk more righteouſly. For,</p>
               <p>(1.) Times and Ages, Men and Cuſtome, are not the guide of his Life, but Conſcience rightly informed by the Word of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) The more looſe his generation is, the more neceſſity he ſees lying upon himſelf to practiſe Holineſs, both to keep it up in the world, and to confute the want of it in other men. If he live in a Covenant-breaking, and Covenant-denying, and Covenant-forſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generation, he ſees that he hath the more reaſon to walk in Covenant maintaining, and Covenant keeping, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(6) <hi>The righteous perſon is one who doth in his heart bewail the unrighteous practices of other men.</hi> This is the Evidence of <hi>Lots</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 8. That righteous man dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among them, in ſeeing, and hearing, <hi>vexed his righteous ſoul from day to day with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful deeds.</hi> Thus alſo did the Holy men in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in a time of wickedneſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. The ſins, which were a ſport to others, were a ſad grief to their ſoules. When others were ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their idols, they were ſorrowing for that mirth: they did not onely murmure againſt their ſins, but they did mourn for them, and that with ſighing and tears.</p>

1. A righteous man knowes both the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of ſinne, and the miſchiefe of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A righteous perſon hath fervent love to <hi>God,</hi> and hearty Affection to the ſoules of men: this makes him mourn for the ſins he cannot mend.</p>
               <p>(7) <hi>The righteous perſon is one who is gladly willing to be told of any act of unrighteouſneſs.</hi> He is ſorry to do unrighteouſly; but not ſorry to be told of his unrighteous Doing. He will thank God for making any an Inſtrument of reproving, and he will honour and love the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for his faithfull admonition. He will not like <hi>Ahab</hi> impriſon a <hi>Micajah,</hi> nor yet with <hi>Herod</hi> cut off the head of a faithfull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover; but will be pleaſed with the diſcovery of ſinne, though from an enemy. Famous and renowned is the example of <hi>David</hi> for this, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32, 33. He had received an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy affront from a man to whom he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much kindneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>The men were very good to us, neither miſſed we any thing as long as we were converſant with them in the field,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now he was upon his march in the heat of blood to avenge that wrong: It was but a woman who came to meet him, and one who was ſo neerly related to <hi>Nabal,</hi> that what ſhe ſaid, might be rendred ſuſpected; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170109:89"/>
ſhe ſpake both Reaſon and Religion, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was convinced of his ſinne, bleſſed <hi>God,</hi> and bleſſeth her, retreats from his march; yea, his ſoul was ſo knit to <hi>Abigail</hi> for her faithful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that as ſoon as her husband was dead, he took her to wife, &amp; ſhe was ever after precious in his ſight. <hi>Solomon</hi> maks this a diſtinctive note between the godly wiſe, and the wicked: the one loves ſinne, but hates rebuke: the other loves rebuke, but hates ſinne, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 8. A faithful Reprover, is as a Looking-glaſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſpots are ſeen; and he that loves to be clean, hates no Looking-glaſs, unleſs it be a falſe one, that makes him fairer then he is. A faithful Rebuker is as a Phyſician to the ſoul, he comes to lance, but it is in order to a cure: no man that loves to live, hates the Phyſician, unleſs he be in a diſtemper; but honours him, and bids him welcome. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs; let him reprove me, it ſhall be a precious oyl, which ſhall not break my head:</hi> ſo the righteous perſon thinketh, and ſo he ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141. 5. A righteous perſon is as willing to have his ſinne diſcovered, as his graces; and as willing to be ſmitten for his ſinne, as encouraged for well-doing. He loves a plain-dealing Miniſtry, that will tell him of his ſinne without flattery: he would not have bitter put for ſweet, or ſweet for bitter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wherein the uſefulneſs of this Breaſt-plate ſtands, as to the reſiſting of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170109:89"/>
I ſhal ſhew you this in theſe three Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1) <hi>Righteouſneſs gives boldneſs and courage to the ſoul in the day of Temptation.</hi> Reſolution of ſpirit is of very great advantage to a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier: If the heart be faint, the hands tremble. When the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went out to War againſt their enemies, <hi>God</hi> gave this Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, that the Officers ſhould make a Proclamation in the head of the Army, That whoſoever was fearfull and faint-hearted, ſhould go and return to his houſe, leſt his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns heart faint as well as his, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 8. Cowardlineſs doth give a very great advantage to the enemy. Now Righteouſneſs, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of life, makes the ſoul valiant. <hi>Hic murus aheneus eſto, Nil conſcire ſibi nullâ palleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere culpâ.</hi> Innocency of life, is the beſt Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial to remove tremblings from the ſoul. <hi>Pro:</hi> 28. 1. <hi>The wicked flee, when no man purſueth; but the Righteous are bold as a Lyon.</hi> The word is, <hi>as a young Lyon,</hi> in the Hebrew: Of all Beaſts, the Lyon is moſt valiant; he is the King of Beaſts; and of all Lyons, the young Lyon is moſt valiant, in regard of the abundance of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heat which is in him. Righteouſneſſe gives a Lyon-like boldneſs to the ſoul in the day of Temptation: guilt makes the heart melt. <hi>Thou haſt driven me out this day from the face of the earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me,</hi> Gen.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170109:90"/>
4. 14. <hi>Carnificem fuum gerebat;</hi> his Conſcience was his Tormenter, and the guilt of his ſinne did ſo infeeble his ſpirits, that though there was not then a man living beſides his Father, yet he thought he ſhould be taken away by a violent death.</p>
               <p>Now the ground of the courage ariſing from Righteouſneſs, is, not from the merit of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; for, in reſpect of Merit, all our Righteouſneſſes are as a filthy rag, <hi>Iſa</hi> 64. 6. But, upon theſe conſiderations, it makes the ſoul valiant, in that (1.) It pacifieth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by giving us an evidence of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and of the acceptance of our perſons, through grace, in the ſight of <hi>God.</hi> Holineſſe, and Righteouſneſſe, is an Argument that we are the redeemed Ones of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74, 75. Righteouſneſs of Converſation, gives the ſoul an evidence of its election, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. Departing from Iniquity, is a teſtimony that a perſon is ſealed up for ſalvation, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life: <hi>vid.</hi> 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 9, 10. (2.) It gives courage, in that it lets a ſoul ſee that it hath a right to all the Promiſes. All the Promiſes are made to righteous walking: Promiſes of Support, Promiſes of perſeverance, Promiſes of deliverance; Righteouſneſs gives the ſoul a propriety in all theſe, and ſo makes it valiant: See but that one Promiſe, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 18. that is a Promiſe of ſecurity againſt Satan.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:170109:90"/>
He <hi>ſhall not touch him,</hi> that is, not with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Touch; he ſhall not draw him into that ſin which is unto death; he ſhall not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally overcome him, &amp;c. This Promiſe is made to every one that is born of God; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is born of God, doth righteouſly, as he is righteous: the righteous man, and the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, are all one.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Righteouſneſs makes the ſoul strong, as well as valiant.</hi> Strength and Power is of very great uſe to a ſouldier in the day of battel: it makes him able both to defend himſelf, and to offend his enemy. Now Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, ſtrengthens a Chriſtian two ways.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In that it doth demoliſh and deſtroy that which makes the ſoul weak.</hi> Sin is the weakneſs and infirmity of the ſoul: it is the Devils great ſtrength, and that which gives him all the advantage he hath againſt the ſoul: Our ſins, are Satans Armour, that wherein he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, and with which he fighteth againſt us: if he did not find aſſiſtance within us, he could not do us any miſchief by that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us. <hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me,</hi> Joh. 14. 30. and becauſe he had nothing in him, he could do nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Our ſinnes are the Devils ſtrong Holds, in which he fights againſt us. Now Righteouſneſs doth expell ſinne, as the Light expelleth the darkneſs: It doth caſt down theſe ſtrong Holds; it doth diſſolve the works
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170109:91"/>
of the Devil, and taketh from him that Armor wherein he truſteth and ſo gives us ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſtrengthens the ſoul, in that it brings with it all ſtrength. Whereſoever Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is, there is God, and there is Chriſt, and there's the Spirit; the Spirit of Might, and the Spirit of Power. 'Tis true, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not either in the heart, or in the life, till God have wrought it. Righteouſneſs doth not bring God, but God brings Righteouſneſs unto the ſoul: but when God hath wrought this Work, then doth Holineſs engage God. Righteouſneſs puts the ſoul under the ſhadow of Gods wings, ſo that whatſoever ſtrength, power and vertue is in God, is engaged for the righteous mans defence. This ye have clearly laid down, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. It was the great happineſs of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, that the Eternal God was their refuge, <hi>Dent.</hi> 33. 27. This was their ſtrength in all the battels they fought; and he that walkes holily is under this happineſs; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 11.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Without righteouſneſs of life, no uſe can be made of any other pieces of this Armour.</hi> 1. He cannot gird himſelf with Truth: Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, and truth of heart, are as the tree and fruit, they alwayes go together: he that hath an unholy life, is certainly unholy in heart: the Kings daughter is all glorious within, and her Cloathing of wrought gold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:170109:91"/>
2. He cannot put on the ſhooes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of peace; <hi>for there is no peace to the wicked,</hi> ſaith my <hi>God, Eſa</hi> 57, 21.</p>
               <p>3. He cannot put on the Helmet of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. A man who is unholy in life, is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all true hopes of Heaven; for every one that hath this hope purifyeth himſelf, as <hi>God</hi> is pure, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
               <p>(4.) Nor can he take the Shield of Faith, Faith is alwayes an heart-purifying grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. A wicked life is the conſequence of an unbelieving heart.</p>
               <p>(5.) Nor can he take the Sword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: This ſword is not a defending ſword, but a wounding ſword to an unholy life: every part of Gods Word, is, for the preſent, againſt him: the word <hi>terrifyeth</hi> and condemneth him.</p>
               <p>(6.) Nor will Prayer and Supplication do him any good: God hath no ear for the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a wicked man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66. 18. yea his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are turned into ſin, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 9. But now he whoſe converſation is righteous, can make uſe of all the other. He can uſe the girdle; he can, and may draw comforts from the Goſpel of peace; he may cover himſelf with the ſhield of Faith; the Sword of the Spirit is a defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Weapon to him, and his prayers are full of virtue and efficacy.</p>

Men do not uſe to blame a ſouldier that goes to meet a cruel and potent enemy, becauſe he is carefull to provide a ſtrong Breaſt-plate: they rather blame his raſhneſs and indiſcretion, that ſhall go naked: Righteouſneſs is the onely Breaſt-plate to keep out Satans arrows, and therefore they are very wiſe, whatever men think, who
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170109:92"/>
are careful both to provide it, and wear it.</p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>We need not wonder to ſee men of diſſolute and leud lives, to be ſo wofully ſubdued unto the will of Satan, and ſo unable to reſiſt any temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Well ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>That the Prince of the power of the Air, worketh in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience,</hi>

Amongſt many other Reaſons that might be rendred, the Doctrine gives us one, which is ſufficient to ſtay our wonderment: Their breaſt lies naked to his arrows, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot but fall; and when they are fallen, they cannot recover.

The honeſty of the lives of Gods people, will ſtop the mouthes of the wicked; but the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and blameableneſs of their Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be an occaſion to make them ſpeak evill, both of God, and of his Religion, unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unrighteous Actings will lay a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block in the way of many, upon which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170109:93"/>
they may ſtumble into Hell. Now Chriſtians are forbidden to give any offence, either to Jew or Gentile, or to the Church of God, <hi>vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>Many ſhall follow, &amp;c.</hi> by reaſon of whom the way of truth ſhall be evill ſpoken of: when Chriſtians that have profeſſed and practiſed the truth, ſhall apoſtatize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> men, that never cared for the truth, ſhall ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the end of their contendings about truth! <hi>Davids</hi> ſin did much hurt in this reſpect, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. This is that which God chargeth upon his people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 20.</p>
               <p>Now a holy life removes this ſcandall.</p>
               <p>2. Mot. <hi>The want of a righteous life will grieve the holy Spirit of God.</hi> This is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Argument, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 28. 29, 30. <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more, &amp;c.</hi> The ſpirit of God cannot properly be grieved. <hi>God</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

To grieve the ſpirit of a man, is a very ſinful thing, much more to grieve the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a good man; but moſt of all, to grieve the ſpirit of <hi>God.

1. <hi>Study well the righteouſneſs, purity and holineſs of the Nature of God.</hi> The Holineſs of God is the Originall of all holineſs. It is both the Motive and the Example of all holineſs in the Creature: when the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates the holineſs of God, he cries out of his own unholineſs, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6. 3. 5. <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of Hoasts, woe is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips.</hi> He that is much employed in the contemplation of the purity of God, will not take any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in his own impurity. The holineſs of God in Scripture is propounded for this very purpoſe, that by looking upon it, the Sons of men may ſtir up their mindes to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue holineſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. 16. As he who hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of converſation, becauſe it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy. It is ignorance of God, or forgetfulneſs, which is the cauſe of the love of unholineſs. When the ſoul comes once in good earneſt, to conſider the purity of God, his own impurity will be his ſorrow and burden. Theſe thoughts will let the ſoul ſee, that its impoſſible for him to have any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with ſuch a God, to whom he is ſo unlike. Similitude is the ground of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as diſſimilitude is of diſunion and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. This is that which the Apoſtle layes as one foundation of comfortable communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, <hi>James</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>that holy thing, Luke</hi> 1. 35. This conſideration would mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame a Chriſtian to the love and practice of holineſs; for he would thus argue with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Is it meet, that ſo corrupt a member ſhould have ſo holy a head? Is it meet, ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Maſter ſhould have ſo unholy Diſciples? There are two principall ends of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt, One is, that he might in our nature make ſatisfaction for our guilt. The other is, that he might fulfill all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for us, and that there might be in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a perfect pattern of holineſs for our Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21. leaving us an example, &amp;c.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170109:95"/>
And no man can expect any benefit by Chriſts ſatisfaction, who doth not endeavour the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of his example: thou haſt no hopes of being healed with his ſtripes, if thou be not willing to be guided by his example, verſ. 21. 23, 24. Upon this ground it is evident, that the ſtudying of his holineſs, will be of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe to make us holy. Its the Apoſtles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Look back often to the righteouſneſs of the ſtate of innocency.</hi> Mankind was created at the firſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> after the Image of God, in holineſs and righteouſneſs: he had both the girdle of truth upon his loyns, and the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs upon his breaſt: there was no impurity within, there was no irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity outwardly, till he had ſinned. Serious meditations of this, will have ſome influence upon the ſoul, to help forward the practice of holineſs. There is a naturall deſire in all men, in whom there is any nobleneſs of ſpirit, to regain and recover the honours preferments and Revenues, which have of ancient time been inſtated upon their Families. The very reading of ſome ancient Records, which ſhew that ſuch Dignities have been conferred upon their predeceſſors, doth put an edge upon their ſpirits, to endeavour that they and their poſterity may be reinveſted with the ſame dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. When the ſecond Temples foundation was laid after the return of the people from
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170109:96"/>
captivity its ſaid, that many of the Prieſts and Levites, and chief of the Fathers, who were ancient men, that had ſeen the firſt Temple, wept with a loud voice, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 12. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter houſe was more glorious then the firſt, in this reſpect, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come to his Temple, and fill it with his glory, he of whom the Temple was a Type. But in regard of outward magnificency, the former Temple did far excel this, and therefore the old men wept, when they ſaw this begun, to think how far ſhort it cam of the other, I would apply it to our purpoſe thus. If a Chriſtian would but view the firſt Temple, &amp; behold often the glorious holineſs of man in Paradice, he would not be able to look upon the preſent miſcarriages of his life without weeping. It would make him uſe all endeavour to bring up both his inward and outward man to ſome good proportion, (at leaſt as much as is poſſible) to that Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of originall righteouſneſs, which is quite loſt by the Fall. And for this purpoſe, it is, that God hath left ſome <hi>rudera</hi> abiding ſtill in man, that by viewing the firſt building, he may be provoked to endeavour the repair of it. The Apoſtle makes this as a help to direct the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to exact holineſs of life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 22. 23, 24. Put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs.</p>

(4.) <hi>Meditate on the righteouſneſs of that place, whither you deſire to be tranſlated after this life.</hi> Heaven hath nothing in it but holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glory: its called in Scripture, <hi>an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance undefiled,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. and the Holy Ghoſt tells us, there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it, any thing that defileth, neither whatſoever worketh abomination, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous ſhall never inherit the Kingdom of <hi>God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. The cleanneſs and beautiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a room is a great perſwaſion to men to cleanſe their feet, that they may be fit to enter into it. Heaven is a clean place, the ſtreets of that City are pure gold, as it were tranſparent glaſſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 21. A ſpotted life is not fit for an unſpotted Heaven. Follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. It is not the happineſs of the Servants of <hi>God</hi> to be at peace with all men in this world; they do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, but they cannot overtake it; but holy they muſt be, elſe they ſhall have no part in the Kingdom of holineſs. When a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to plant himſelf into forraign parts, he is very careful to be as well acquainted as may be, both with the Language and cuſtoms of that Countrey. Every Chriſtian deſires to be tranſplanted into Heaven, a place of holineſs, and therefore ſhould be careful to be fitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, for that holy place. A heavenly converſation is fit for one, who intends to be an Inhabitant in Heaven, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. 13.</p>

(5.) <hi>Conſider the righteouſneſs of your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian profeſſion.</hi> Your profeſſion is a profeſſion of holineſs, and its fit the practice ſhould be anſwerable to the Profeſſion. A Chriſtian call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is an high Calling, Kings, Prieſts, &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 14. and it is alſo an holy Calling, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are called to be Saints. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy Calling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. And if a Chriſtian would but well remember, either the highneſs or holineſs of his Calling, he would not walk ſo diſorderly, as ſometimes he doth. Mens Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are very forcible to take them off from employments that are unſuitable, and to put them upon ſuch as are agreeable to their Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. A Merchant will not rake in Dunghills, it is work unfit for his Calling. Kings will not buy and ſell, and trade; it is not ſuitable to their Calling. It is not for Kings, oh <hi>Lemuel,</hi> it is not for Kings to drink wine, nor for Princes, ſtrong drink. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 4. It is not for any perſon to be given to drink, &amp;c. but of all men, its moſt unfit for Kings to do it. Their imployment is of a higher nature, then the employment of ordinary men. When <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> was tempted to have fled from his work, into the Temple for ſafety, the conſideration of his profeſſion kept him from yielding. Should ſuch a man as I flee? <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 11. I who came hither to ſtand out againſt oppoſition, I who have had ſuch experience of divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, I that have profeſſed ſo much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170109:97"/>
in <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c. If ſuch Meditations were fixed upon a Chriſtians heart, he would never willingly give way to any unrighteous practice.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) <hi>Conſider much of the righteouſneſs and holineſs of that word of God, which is given for the rule of your walking.</hi> Every word of <hi>God</hi> is pure. The Law of <hi>God</hi> is a holy and righteous Law, the Goſpel is a Goſpel of holineſs; and its fit that ſuch as have choſen this Rule, ſhould be holy in all manner of Converſation. The Apoſtle gives this, both as a Motive and Direction to holy walking, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Let your Converſation be as becommeth the Goſpel, Phil.</hi> 1. 27. And <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. The grace of <hi>God</hi> that bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and godly in this preſent world. He that hath the Goſpel before his eyes, will put away ſin from his eyes. <hi>I thought on thy precepts, and turned my feet to thy Commandments,</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Pſal.</hi> 119. 59. he that forgets <hi>Gods</hi> Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, will ſoon be drawn aſide from the way of obedience; but he that carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members theſe, will walk holily. <hi>David</hi> gives this as the reaſon, why the godly man doth not walk in the way of the ungodly, nor ſtand in the way of ſinners, nor ſit in the ſeat of ſcorners, becauſe his delight is in the word of <hi>God,</hi> and therein he meditates day and night, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2, 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 18.</p>

(7) <hi>Study carefully the great and many privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which are inſtated upon you, in, and by the Covenant of Grace.</hi> The end of all the Dignities confer'd by God upon men, is, in reſpect of them, that they ſhould walk in newneſs of life. Election is for this end, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4. God hath choſen men in Chriſt before the foundation of the world, (not becauſe they were holy, but) that they ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love. The end of Redemption is holineſs of life, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 75. Chriſt came as much to redeem the people from iniquity, as from hell, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. The end of Adoption is, that we ſhould be harmleſs and blameleſs the Sons of <hi>God</hi> without rebuke, that we ſhould live as <hi>Gods</hi> children, and walk as Children of the Light. The end of our Juſtification is Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Life: many leud and ignorant Chriſtians argue from priviledges to lazineſs: they continue in ſinne, becauſe grace abounds. But the Scripture argues from great priviledges to purity of life: <hi>vid. Rom.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>I beſeech you therefore Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. The particular mercy he had ſpoken to, is the great mercy of a ſinners juſtification by faith. Of this he had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting in the former Chapter. In the 12. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he comes to make the main Uſe of it, which is an Exhortation to Holineſs. And from the ſame Doctrine, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 1. he draws the very ſame inference; <hi>I therefore the priſoner of the Lord beſeech you,</hi> &amp;c. The end of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, is holineſs of life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Having</hi>

                  <hi>therefore theſe Promiſes,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> from many other rare priviledges, drawes the ſame concluſion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11, 12. Diſhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty of Converſation, doth not onely convince a Chriſtian of unthankfulneſs for his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, but it is a ſhame to his priviledges.</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) <hi>Meditate much on the unrighteouſneſs of your former converſation, when ye knew not God.</hi> It is the mind of <hi>God,</hi> that Chriſtians, after their effectual converſion, ſhould remember their unregenerate condition, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. There are many good uſes which a Chriſtian may make of ſuch meditations; it makes him thankful, &amp;c. Amongſt others, this is one, it will be a good help to promote his holy walking, after Converſion. Such meditations will bring to his mind. (1.) The filthineſs of ſinne, which will ſet his heart againſt it. And (2.) they will let him ſee how much time he waſted in ſinne, which will be a great help to make him more careful, for the future, over his wayes. This is laid down in many places of Scripture, as a help to holy walking: <hi>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3. the Apoſtle, in the ſecond verſe, exhorts them to ceaſe from ſinne; and his Argument is, becauſe that was their practice in the days of their vanity, when they walked after the courſe of the world. And we have the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Not faſhioning your ſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former luſts in your ignorance.</hi> This is one Reaſon why ſuch as have been moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly wicked before Converſion, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

more then ordinarily holy after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: When ſinne hath abounded before Regeneration, Grace hath much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in them after Converſion. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> one of the moſt noted ſinners of her age, (our Saviour caſt 7 Devils out of her;) and, after her Calling, one of the moſt exact Chriſtians of her time.

The Apoſtle, upon this ground, argues with the Romanes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Baptiſm is a holy Bond, which though it be but once entred into, yet the obligation of it remains for ever upon the ſoul.

faith in Chriſt without the works of the Law Its called in the Scripture ſometimes, <hi>The word of Gods grace, Acts</hi> 14. 3. becauſe it doth reveal the riches of Gods grace to the children of men for their ſalvation<hi>:</hi> Sometimes its called, <hi>the word of faith, Rom.</hi> 10. 8. becauſe it holds out faith in Chriſt as the inſtrumental cauſe of our ſalvation. Sometimes its called, <hi>the grace of God, Titus</hi> 2. 11. Sometimes its called, <hi>the myſtery of Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 3. 4. becauſe it doth reveal Jeſus Chriſt to the ſons of men in his perſon, natures, offices, benefits conveyed by him to ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive Sometimes, <hi>the hidden wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170109:101"/>
goodneſs and mercy that God ever manifeſted to his creatures is contained in the Goſpel. God was very good to man in creation, the goodneſs of God was expreſſed in the Covenant of works, but the higheſt expreſſion of goodneſs and love lies in the Goſpel. And in the Text its called, <hi>the Goſpel of peace,</hi> the reaſon of which we ſhall ſee when we have done with the next particle: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What peace is here meant. There is a threefold peace. 1. Peace with the Creature, of this <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, Chap. 5. 23. <hi>Thou ſhalt be in league with the ſtones of the field, and the beaſts of the field ſhall be in peace with thee.</hi> He is ſaid to be at peace with the Creatures, who is in ſuch a condition, that no Creature can be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his hurt, but all creatures are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his good and ſerviceable to him for his advantage. <hi>All things are yours, things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and things to come.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22. 2. Peace with a mans ſelf. Peace of conſcience, of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>The God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing.</hi> This peace is a fruit and conſequence of faith; of this our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me, &amp;c. and ye ſhall find reſt to your ſoules.</hi> When the ſoul apprehending the pardon of ſin, and aſſurance of Gods love, is freed from thoſe fears and horrors which attend unjuſtified ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. 3. Peace with God. Which is nothing elſe but Reconciliation with God through Jeſus Chriſt, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170109:102"/>
For the underſtanding of this we are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der man in his threefold ſtate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In the ſtate of Innocency.</hi> In this ſtate man had peace and communion with God<hi>:</hi> God and man were united in a Covenant of friendſhip. There was nothing but Amicableneſs between God and man<hi>:</hi> man was able to know God as the chief good. To will God as the laſt end of all. To give God the glory of his works active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. To converſe with God. There was nothing in him oppoſite to God, or in God, till man by ſin on his part had made a breach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In the ſtate of corruption, or the fallen eſtate of man.</hi> This is a ſtate of enmity and wrath, God and man in this ſtate are at deadly fewd one with another. They are ſaid to be afarre off from God; they are ſaid to be, <hi>without hope and without God in the world, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. Sin hath made ſuch a wide diſtance, that there is no hopes for God and man to come together as friends, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſome meanes be uſed for the removal of this diſtance. This is the ſtate in which all unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſons are, <hi>The wrath of God abideth on them, John</hi> 3. 36. In this ſtate man is oppoſite to God, His nature is oppoſite to God, His wayes are contrary to God. His heart is full of hatred to him. And in this ſtate God hath put man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 30.</note> the curſe, and is reſolved to have his envy out of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>In the ſtate of Graee or regeneration.</hi> This is a ſtate of reconciliation. It conſiſts in theſe four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The wrath and diſpleaſure on Gods part is quite done away, ſo that he loves the perſons
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170109:102"/>
and carrieth no indignation in his breaſt againſt them.</p>
               <p>Some think that there is no reall wrath in God towards the veſſels of election, while they are in their natural condition, onely it is ſo in the apprehenſion of the elect, and that reconciliation is begun when they apprehend it.</p>
               <p>But certain it is, that there is not onely an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Gods wrath, but they are really under Gods wrath, God hath really put them under the creatures, and under the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt was not onely in apprehenſion, but really under the wrath of God; he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made a curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. God put him under the Law, to be dealt withal as thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law.</p>
               <p>Now by reconciliation this wrath is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Yet doth not this imply any change in God, for God is to be conſidered two wayes.</p>
               <p>1. As he is in himſelf. And ſo he hath not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things in him. Thoſe inward acts of God are his Being, and there are not ſeveral Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes in him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. As he is pleaſed to manifeſt himſelf in his ſeveral wayes and workings towards his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in this reſpect, according as the Creature is in himſelf, ſo is Gods reflection upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; (as the Sun through the glaſs ſhines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the colour of the glaſs.) Now it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies no mutation in Gods Being to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diverſly in his working towards the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to their different condition.</p>
               <p>2. God takes away the enmity that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170109:103"/>
in the hearts of men, and ſo makes them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept of Reconciliation, and to be at peace with him.</p>
               <p>3. There is a ſolemn league and covenant made, wherein God and man joyn together, which the Scripture cals a Covenant of Grace, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 19, 02.</p>
               <p>4. There is mutual friendſhip and delight between God and the Creature, whereby God communicates his good unto the Creature, and the Creature communicates his good of love, fear, ſervice and obedience unto God. God ſaith to the Creature, I will be thy God; the Creature ſaith to God, behold I am thy ſervant, thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to honour, obey, ſerve thee for ever.</p>
               <p>Now this Peace is wrought in and by Jeſus Chriſt, by way of tranſaction with the Father, and that after this manner.</p>
               <p>1. He is willing to be charged with our debt. 2. He is willing to ſatisfie the fulleſt demands of Divine wrath and juſtice for our debt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 10. 3. He undertakes alſo to bring poor Creatures to ſubmit to God, to love him, to fear him, to give up themſelves to be ruled and governed by him; of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks plainly, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 20, 21, 22. <hi>And (having made peace through the bloud of his croſs) by him to reconcile all things to himſelf: by him, I ſay, whether things in heaven or things in earth. And you that were ſometimes ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, in the body of his fleſh, through death, to preſent you holy and unblameable, and unreprovable in his ſight.</hi> Ieſus Chriſt did as well undertake to make the elect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170109:103"/>
as to free them from condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Now though the Goſpell be called a Goſpell of peace in reſpect of all theſe, yet this laſt is principally to be underſtood in this place, the two former are but effects and conſequences of this. The Goſpel is a Goſpel of Reconciliation, ſo the Apoſtle cals it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
               <p>3. In what reſpects is the Goſpel a Goſpel of peace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In regard of Diſcovery and manifeſtation.</hi> The Goſpel is that which makes known this peace unto the ſons of men. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith.</hi> As life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is brought to light by the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 1. 10. ſo is peace and reconciliation. The Goſpel is that ſilver Trumpet by which this Jubile of peace is proclaimed to the world. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 36. The word which God ſent unto the children of Iſrael, <hi>preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is the Goſpel which preacheth this peace to men. The world was never acquainted with this peace till the Goſpel of God came to their eares. The Nations that want the Goſpel are meer ſtrangers to this peace. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 79. It is the light of the Goſpel that guides mens feet into the way of this peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In regard of Conveyance and Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The Goſpel doth not onely barely publiſh, but doth actually work this peace. It is by the Spirit of God, through the preaching of the Goſpel, that the hearts of men are inclined to accept of this peace. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 2. 3. The Lord
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170109:104"/>
ſhall ſend the rod of his ſtrength out of <hi>Zion, i. e.</hi> the Goſpel, and then it followeth, <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power;</hi> when the rod of Gods ſtrength comes effectually to work upon the ſoul, then is the unwilling ſoul made willing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Inregard of Conſervation.</hi> The Goſpel is the Ark, wherein are kept all the Articles and Agreements between God and man. All the tranſactions between God and Chriſt, for the making of this peace are preſerved and kept ſafe in the Goſpel. This is the golden pot, wherein this Manna is preſerved for all the generations of the Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>In regard of Recovery.</hi> When the ſoul that is reconciled to God hath loſt the ſenſe and apprehenſion of its peace with God, it doth by the ſtudying and hearing of the Goſpel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and recover the aſſurance of its former Peace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>In regard of Confirmation.</hi> The Goſpel ſeals and confirms this peace.</p>
               <p>4, I ſhall now anſwer one Objection: <hi>viz.</hi> that of our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 34. <hi>Think not that I am come to ſend peace on earth, I came not to ſend peace but a ſword, for I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt his father,</hi> &amp;c. and we ſee by experience; that where the Goſpel comes, diviſions, contentions and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellings do preſently ariſe, &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 49. <hi>I am come to ſend fire on the earth, and what would I if it be already kindled?</hi> Hence ſome have prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſhed the Bible burnt, as the great Incendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:170109:104"/>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Theſe Contentions are not the naturall effects of the Goſpel, for it doth naturally work peace and amity, <hi>The Wiſdom which is from above is firſt pure and then peaceable, &amp;c.</hi> Jam. 3. 17. but they ariſe accidentally from the Goſpel. The Goſpel meets with the luſts and corruptions of mens hearts, and theſe being awakened breed contentions. The Devil he is inraged againſt the Goſpel, and therefore he ſtirs up mens cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to make head againſt it. The Goſpel cals upon men to be ſtrict, holy, to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, &amp;c. the natural heart abhors this, and ſo becomes, not onely diſobedient, but contentious, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>The Goſpel is the cauſe of Contentions, as meat is the cauſe of ill humours. The naturall property of it is to nouriſh, &amp;c. but becauſe it meets with a diſeaſed ſtomack, it accidentally weakens. Or as a good phyſick is the cauſe of ſickneſſes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Information. We may from hence draw many concluſions<hi>: Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>This ſhews the pretiouſneſs and glory of the Goſpel.</hi> The Apoſtle cals it a glorious Goſpel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 11. The miniſtry of the Law was glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but the Goſpel is much more glorious<hi>: vid.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Many things there are that proclaim the glorious excellency of the Goſpel: I ſhall not inſtance in any other than what is in the Text; <hi>Its a Goſpel of peace.</hi> Peace is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing, the loweſt of all kinds of peace is one of the greateſt of outward bleſſings, peace with men. Its that which often in Scripture compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all outward bleſſings. Its the breeder
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170109:105"/>
and preſerver of all outward happineſs; plenty is the daughter of peace, <hi>Micah</hi> 4. 3. Its the ſweetner of all outward mercies. Peace is as ſalt to meat, as the light to the World. How much more glorious is this peace, Peace with God? The peace of conſcience is a peace tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending humane underſtanding, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4 7. and that is but the fruit of this peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the miniſtey of the Goſpel is a glorious miniſtry.</hi> They are the Ambaſſadors of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of peace. <hi>Iſai,</hi> 62. 7. <hi>How beautiful upon the mounts are the feet of them that bring glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that publiſh peace.</hi> The word of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is committed to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of warre are unwelcome meſſengers to all Nations, but thoſe that come to proclaim peace are kindly received. And yet a wretched world is as weary of the miniſtry of the Goſpel, as if it were the miniſtration of death: Moſt do as the <hi>Gadarenes</hi> did by Chriſt, intreat them to depart out of their coaſts. <hi>Noah</hi> was glad when the Dove came with an olive branch<hi>:</hi> if the peace of the Goſpel had more place in the hearts of men, the publiſhers of it would have more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the profeſſors of the Goſpel ſhould be of peaceable diſpoſitions.</hi> The Goſpel when it comes with power makes men like it ſelf; it tames and ſweetens the ſpirits of men; makes rough pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſmooth, men of rough, boyſtrous and fierce ſpirits to become gentle, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11. 6, 7, 8, 9. Implacableneſs and violence of Spirit as it doth much diſhonour the Goſpel of peace, ſo is it a frame altogether anti-evangelical. The Goſpel
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170109:105"/>
hath no leaven or ſourneſs in it, and he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth the Goſpel ſhould be ſo likewiſe<hi>: If ye have heard him, and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jeſus, put away malice, &amp;c. Epheſ.</hi> 4. 21, 31. Whereſoever the Goſpel comes with effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and power, it doth imprint upon the ſoul its own image, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>But God be thanked, that ye were the ſervants of ſin: but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine, which was delivered to you.</hi> As the Goſpel is holy, ſo ſhould the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it be holy. As the Goſpel is heavenly, ſo ſhould the profeſſors of it be heavenly: and as the Goſpel is a Goſpel of peace, ſo they that profeſs it ſhould be men of peace. The Apoſtle deſires the <hi>Philippiane,</hi> that their converſation might be as becometh the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. A peaceable converſation is a Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This lets us ſee what a great loſs it is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Goſpel.</hi> Its threatned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as one of the ſoreſt judgements, <hi>Math</hi> 21. 43. <hi>The Kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you,</hi> &amp;c. Its a great loſs to looſe the loweſt kind of peace, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 4. much more to looſe the Goſpel which conveyes the higheſt peace. You that are unreconciled, if the Goſpel go, you are like to die in your enmity; and you that are reconciled, will have no ordinary meanes left you, either of preſerving or renewing the aſſurance of your reconciliation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This lets us ſee why it is that Satan is ſuch an enemy to the ſpreading of the Goſpel.</hi> In all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we find, that his great plot hath been, either to remove or to corrupt the Goſpel. All the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170109:106"/>
falſe Teachers which aroſe in the Goſpel Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were raiſed for this end: he hath ſtirred up Hereticks and Tyrants in every age to blow out the Goſpel. <hi>I would have come to you once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but Satan hindred,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>vid.

                  <p>Examination. <hi>Let all try whether they have an intereſt in this peace, which is publiſhed in, and confirmed by the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VVHether the Goſpel have wrought this great work between God and them, that they can ſay God and they are at peace. Its neceſſary to make this inquiry. 1. Becauſe all men by nature are under wrath and enmity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. 2. Becauſe its very natural to the ſons of men to ſuppoſe and conclude, that God and they are at peace, eſpecially ſuch as have lived under the Goſpel of peace.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to poſitive evidences, I ſhall diſcover ſome miſtakes or falſe reaſonings about this peace; and they are of two ſorts. 1. Such as are made evidences of peace, and are not, theſe concern wicked men. 2. Such as the godly are under, arguing thoſe things to be evidences of want of peace which are not ſo.</p>
                  <p>For the former.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>No man can argue that he is at peace with God, becauſe of the enjoyment of outward common Priviledges.</hi> As Baptiſme, the admiſſion of a perſon to the Lords Table.

Thou maiſt enjoy all the outward priviledges of the friends of God, and yet live and die in enmity: So did <hi>Iſhmael, Saul, Judas, Simon Magus,</hi> and yet had neither part nor lot in this matter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>No man can argue that he is at peace with God, becauſe of outward Profeſsion.</hi> The worſt of men may attain to this. <hi>Judas</hi> was one that made a Profeſſion, he was an Apoſtle, an extraordinary Miniſter, and yet an enemy to God, a child of perdition. Thoſe that ſhall be rejected at the laſt day, are ſuch as made profeſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25, 26, 27. and yet there was no Covenant of peace between God and them: <hi>I know them not.</hi> A man muſt profeſs Religion before he can be an hypocrite.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The bare performance of external duties, and outward actions of Religion, is no Argument that a ſoul is heir to this peace.</hi> For though he that is at peace with God will be careful of doing ſuch duties, yet there is no external duty or action of Religion, which may not be done by one who is in a ſtate of enmity: Actions indeed which are intrinſecally good, as beleiving in God, fearing of God, &amp;c. he cannot do; but all external du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he may do. <hi>Jezebel</hi> ſhe keeps a faſt, an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary duty. <hi>Jehu</hi> goes farther than moſt of

Gods friends in theſe actions, <hi>Reg.</hi> 10 <hi>per tot.</hi> Thoſe in <hi>Eſay</hi> 58. 2, 3, 4, did very much, yet all of them in a ſtate of enmity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Tis no argument to prove, that a man is at peace with God, becauſe he doth not ſhew ſo much enmity againſt God as others do.</hi> A man may farre exceed many others, and yet be no friend, onely he may be a leſs enemy. This was the Phariſees Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>God I thank thee, I am not as other men,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. meer reſtraining grace. Civil edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, carnal policy, want of temptations, and a hundred ſuch things may cauſe a man to hide enmity, and not to ſhew it ſo much as others, and yet he is no friend to God, or God to him. All Serpents have not the ſame meaſure of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>No man can argue, that he is at peace with God, becauſe he is not ſo full of enmity as he was before.</hi> The weapons may perhaps be knocked out of thy hand: Thou maiſt not have the ſame opportunity thou hadſt before to ſhew thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Thy enmity may perhaps have ſome other way of working than before. It may be God hath thee in ſome bonds or other, that thou da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt not ſhew thy ſelf as thou haſt done and wouldeſt do wert thou at liberty. It may be thou art not ſo able to manifeſt thine enmity as thou haſt been. An enemy may be taken priſoner, may be wounded, &amp;c. that he cannot expreſs his emity, and yet have as much gall in him as ever he had.</p>
                  <p>For the latter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A man cannot argue that he is not at peace with God, becauſe of the oppreſſion of ſome outward</hi>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170109:108"/>
                     <hi>Afflictions.</hi> Many of the friends of God reaſon againſt themſelves by this Argument<hi>:</hi> they think if God and they were at peace, they ſhould not feel the blows of his hand, as now they doe. This was the reaſoning which <hi>Jobs</hi> friends uſed to prove God and him to be enemies one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 6, 7. They thought ſuch ſad afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not conſiſtent with a ſtate of peace. This kind of reaſoning would have excluded Jeſus Chriſt himſelf from being at peace with God, who was the beloved of his ſoul. The Jews did upon this ground look upon him as Gods enemy: <hi>Eſay</hi> 53. 4. <hi>Surely he hath born our griefs and carried our ſorrows, yet we did eſteem him ſtricken, ſmitten of God and afflicted.</hi> And ſo they reaſoned againſt him when he was on the Croſs. He truſted in God that he would deliver him, let him deliver if he delight in him, <hi>Math.</hi> 27. 43. The Scripture tels us that this is a falſe rule, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 9. 1. 2. As wicked men cannot argue they are Gods friends, becauſe of freedom from troubles, no more can the godly argue that they are Gods enemies, becauſe of the preſence of ſuch things. God makes his love to his people to be the ground of the chaſtening with the rods of men, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 19. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 7, 8.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A man cannot argue that he is not at peace with God, becauſe he wants the preſent feeling and comfortable evidences of his peace.</hi> Peace may be concluded in Heaven between God and the ſoul, and not yet proclaimed feelingly in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſinner. <hi>Heman</hi> the <hi>Ezrahite</hi> was a man at peace with God, the Scripture gives that teſtimony of him in many places, and yet he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170109:108"/>
wanted the feeling of his peace, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 88. <hi>per totum.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt himſelf did for a time want the preſent comforts of his peace; <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers caſes in which a ſoul, who is at peace with God may be without the preſent apprehenſions thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the beginning and infancy of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: a child hath reaſon as ſoon as he is born, but he wants a reflected act to know that he hath it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the hour of Temptation: when temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is high, conſolation is often low.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the day of ſpiritual Deſertion<hi>:</hi> When God hides his face the ſoul is full of troubles, yea, it walks in darkneſs and can ſee no light, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50. 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the time of Relapſes, when the ſoul hath been overtaken and drawn into ſome ſin. This was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 12. <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation:</hi> he had not loſt the Jewel of ſalvation, but he had loſt the joy of his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>A man cannot argue that he is not at peace with God, becauſe he finds grace to be but very weak.</hi> His faith is but weak, his zeal is but cold, his deſires are but flint, &amp;c. Tis not <hi>ſtrength</hi> of grace but <hi>truth</hi> of grace, which is an evidence of Reconciliation: A little light in the morning is better than the bright moon-ſhine in the night, becauſe tis the light of the morning. God will not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, and man ſhould not deſpiſe it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 10.</p>

                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:170109:109"/>
And beſides: 1. Sometimes ſome graces may be ſuſpended, that ſome other graces may be more fully diſcovered: faith may act but weakly, that humility and ſelf-denial may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
                  <p>2. Sometimes the ſame grace may be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in one act, that it may be more intended in ſome other act, which is every way as profitable for the ſoul. Faith is ſometimes remitted in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of comforting, that it may be intended in its act of purifying.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>A man cannot argue want of peace with God from the preſence of ſome corruption, and the preſent feeling of ſome enmity in the ſoul.</hi> If peace with God were inconſiſtent with the being of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, there would be no peace with God on this ſide heaven. The Song of the Angels at the birth of Chriſt is, Glory be to God on high, <hi>on earth peace, Luke</hi> 2. 14. That clauſe muſt be blotted out, if a ſtate of reconciliation be not conſiſtent with the being of corruption. <hi>Paul</hi> was at peace with God, and yet <hi>he had a law in his members, Rom.</hi> 7. 23. he would have done good, but evill was preſent, he had a body of death and a root of bitterneſs ſtill in him, and this brought forth both gall and wormwood. Freedom from corruption is deſired and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the Saints on earth, but it is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by any but the Saints in heaven. The body of death is not deſtroyed but by the death of the body.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>A man cannot conclude that he is not at peace with God, becauſe his ſins have been very great.</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170109:109"/>
Eſay 55. 7. <hi>As the heavens are high above the earth, ſo are my wayes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> had been a very great ſinner, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. A blaſphemer, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor and injurious, and yet when he wrote that, was under a covenant of peace. So <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But I come to poſitive evidences.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>He that is at peace with God is at war with ſin, with all ſin, and that continually.</hi> Hatred of ſin is a ſure evidence of Reconciliation with God. <hi>I will hearken what the Lord will ſay, for he will ſpeak peace to his Servants, but let not them return again to folly,</hi> Pſal. 85. 8. Folly and ſin are <hi>Synonyma</hi> in Scripture, as holineſs and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are. And he that hath heard God ſpeaking peace, will be very careful of not returning to ſin. A perſon at peace with God may act ſinfully, but he hates it even when he acts it, he mourns for it, he uſeth all meanes to mortifie and deſtroy it. <hi>I will heal their back-ſlidings, I will love them freely,</hi> &amp;c. Ephraim <hi>ſhall ſay, what have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> Hoſea 14. 4, 8. Yea, the ſoul ſhall be aſhamed of its ſinful courſes when God and it are reconciled. There are ſome who think, that ſorrow and ſhame for ſin are unfit for a ſtate of Reconciliation, and that its a diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the ſtate of Reconciliation, to be exerciſed with Humiliation, whereas indeed its the proper fruit of it. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> never abounded ſo much in ſorrow and ſhame for ſin, as after God had ſpoken peace to her; ſhe wept much, becauſe much was forgiven her; and its propheſied of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that ſhame and grief
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170109:110"/>
ſhould fill her heart and face when God was reconciled to her: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 16. 61, 63. Put this home.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He that is at peace with God, is at peace with the Word of God, and every part of it.</hi> Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God brings forth Reconciliation with the Scriptures, with the Precepts as well as with the Promiſes. He is at peace with every duty enjoyned in the Book of God. While the ſoul is at enmity with God, it is at enmity with the world, at leaſt with ſome part of it. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he cannot agree with, this is too ſtrict, the other is too harſh<hi>:</hi> This is an hard ſaying, who can hear it? The Apoſtle deſcribes ſuch men by their <hi>contentiouſneſs</hi> and <hi>diſobedience, Rom.</hi> 2. 8. but when God hath taken away the enmity of the heart, all theſe contentions againſt the Scripture are allayed<hi>:</hi> he now hides the Word within his heart, he loves it and prizeth it more than his appointed food, its the joy and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his heart, ſweeter to his taſte than the honey and honey-comb. The Law is written in his heart, now its his boſome friend, the man of his counſel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>He that is at peace with God is never ſo well as when he is in Gods preſence:</hi> He loves to be where God is. Reconciliation will manifeſt it ſelf by deſire of communion. Enemies care not for the preſence one of another, but friends re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to converſe together. <hi>Tell me, O thou whom my ſoul loveth, where thou feedeſt, Cantic.</hi> 1. 6. A ſoul reconciled is deſcribed by this; <hi>that he is made nigh, Epheſ.</hi> 2. 13. The ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170109:110"/>
reconciliation is farre off from God: farre off in regard of Gods acceptance, and farre off in regard of affection and deſire, but whenſoever reconciled, then the diſtance is removed, and he is brought nigh, nigh in regard of relation, and nigh in regard of affection and union; he takes pleaſure in thoſe places, in thoſe exerciſes, in that ſociety, where God is graciouſly preſent. Put this home. Can you ſay as <hi>Pſal</hi> 84. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>He that is reconciled to God, can never be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented when any breach is made, till it be again made up.</hi> A ſoul at peace with God may by ſin looſe the ſenſe of it, and thereby breed ſtrangeneſs between God and himſelf. But he cannot be at reſt till the cloud be removed. <hi>David Pſalm</hi> 51. 12. he had aſſurance of pardon before. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy ſin,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 13. but Gods face was not as it had wont to be towards him, he could not ſee thoſe ſmiles which he was wont to behold in his fathers face, he could not diſcern the light of Gods countenance as before, this makes him cry out, <hi>Reſtore,</hi> &amp;c. Thus it was with the Church in thoſe remarkable places, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. <hi>inite.</hi> and <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4, 5. She was in a very ſad condition till ſhe had got the fight of his face. A reconciled perſon is afraid of doing any thing that may cauſe ſtrangeneſs, and very reſtleſs till any breach may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:170109:111"/>
5. <hi>He that is at peace with God, is at peace with all the ſervants of God.</hi> He is a true cordial friend unto all thoſe whom God loves, and an adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all thoſe whom God hates. Doe not I love them that love thee, and am not I grieved with thoſe that riſe up againſt thee? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. 21, 22. He will not ſay a confederacy to any, who hate God in any of their ſinful wayes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>He that is at peace with God is a man univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally reformed.</hi> Renovation is alwayes a fruit of Reconciliation. Inwardly in heart, will, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, underſtanding: Outwardly in words and works is he renewed according unto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. God never makes peace with any ſoul, but he makes that ſoul like himſelf. <hi>Old things are paſt away, and all things are become new.</hi> This is the Apoſtles evidence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17, 18.</p>

                  <p>Mot. 1. <hi>Without peace there can be no glory.</hi> Reconciliation is a neceſſary preparative to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. God ſaves no enemies but by making of them friends, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21.</p>

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170109:111"/>
There is more difficulty to reconcile an enemy, than to ſave a friend. There is leſs oppoſition between grace and glory, than between grace and nature, the difference between thoſe is but gradual, but between the other ſpecifical. Hence the Apoſtle argues, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mot. 3. <hi>Peace with God is the foundation of peace with creatures, and peace with conſcience.</hi> The creatures are by ſin our enemies, and nothing but peace with the Creator can make their enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ceaſe. <hi>Vide Hoſea</hi> 2. 18, 19. When God is in covenant, then are the creatures in Covenant; ſo peace of conſcience is a fruit of this peace. He that is at peace with God hath a ground of peace with himſelf, though he do not ſee it. He that is at enmity with God hath no ground of peace, though he think otherwiſe: Conſcience may be ſleepily quiet, but it is not truly peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>Mot. 4. <hi>Peace with God will be your joy and rejoycing in all kind of outward evils:</hi> Otherwiſe the Goſpel of peace will be to you a Goſpel of warre. They ſhall have enmity from God with a witneſs, who die in enmity under the Goſpel: <hi>John</hi> 16. 33.

               <p>That which I ſhall pitch upon, as that which I humbly conceive to be neareſt the meaning of the Apoſtle, is this, <hi>viz.

               <p>
                  <hi>He that would overcome the Devil in the day of temptation, muſt be ſtedfaſtly reſolved to go through</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> 
                  <hi>with the profeſsion of the Goſpel, notwithſtanding all impediments and oppoſitions which he ſhall meet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the handling of this Doctrine I ſhall open theſe two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That God requires this reſolution.</item>
                  <item>2. That this is very neceſſary for him that would ſtand in the day of temptation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. That God requires that every Chriſtian ſhould have theſe ſhooes upon his feet, is expreſly taught in the Scriptures: <hi>Vide Luke</hi> 9. 22, 23, 24. he foretels his own ſufferings, and the ſufferings which thoſe that profeſs his Goſpel muſt expect, and then he armes them with this reſolution. <hi>To take up the croſs and to follow him.</hi> This is that for which the Angel of the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> is commended, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Thou holdeſt faſt my Name, and haſt not denied my faith,</hi> &amp;c. This Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is that which was in <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles; Chriſt tels them, that they ſhould all of them be offended becauſe of him, and they ſhould all be ſcattered from him, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. 31. <hi>Peter</hi> tels him, that for his part he was reſolved that <hi>though he ſhould die with him, yet he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſake him or deny him,</hi> and all the other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples were of the ſame mind, v. 35. here they had theſe ſhooes upon their feet, though they ſhortly after fell off when the ſtorm came.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:170109:114"/>
2. Wherein the uſefulneſs of this Armour lies, as to the reſiſting of temptation.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Theſe reſolutions will exceedingly ſtrengthen the ſoul in the day of temptation.</hi> He that wants theſe ſhooes will be weak when Satan ſets upon him; whereas he that hath theſe upon his feet will be bold and valiant. There is not any better bulwark in the day of battel then Reſolution of heart before the day of battel. Oppoſition may come ſuddenly and violently, but it will not come ſo terrifyingly upon him that hath armed himſelf with Reſolution to ſtand it out. Our Saviour ſets out this by a double Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. which of you intending to build a Tower, &amp;c. A man will never be able to finiſh, that doth not reſolve to be at the full coſt of the building.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Theſe Reſolutions will weaken and diſcourage Satan in his Aſſaults.</hi> Where he ſhall perceive theſe ſhooes upon the feet of the ſoul, he will be much danted and diſhartened in his undertakings. When the Rulers, and Elders, and Scribes, the inſtruments of State, ſaw the reſolvedneſs of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to go on in their way, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all their threatnings and perſecutions, they were much aſtoniſhed, ſaith the Text, <hi>Act.</hi> 4 13. and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jeſus. They thought that there was ſomething more then man in them, which made them ſo regardleſs of their power; and this for the preſent abated their fury, <hi>they threatened them and let them go,</hi> v. 21. had they ſeen that they had been bare-footed their carriage would have been more fierce, but ſeeing them ſhod with theſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170109:115"/>
ſhooes, they were glad to be rid of them.</p>
               <p>Information. 1. <hi>This lets us ſee why it is, that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Apoſtates and Back-ſliders are ſo eaſily carried captive by Satan in the day of temptation.</hi> They want theſe ſhooes upon their feet, and therefore they cannot ſtand. The Heretick fals into the net of Satan, becauſe he wants the girdle of the Truth of Doctrine. The hypocrite he fals, becauſe he wants the girdle of Sincerity. The prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot ſtand, becauſe he wants the breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate<hi>:</hi> and the Apoſtate is overcome, becauſe he is without the ſhooes of the preparation of the Goſpel, either he hath no reſolution, or no well-grounded reſolution. The Apoſtate is the ſtony ground, he may hear the Word, and receive it with joy, but when perſecution ariſeth becauſe of the Word, he is preſently offended, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 20, 21. if you would be preſerved from falling by temptation, you muſt labour to be preſerved from backſliding from profeſſion.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>This lets us ſee, that it is a difficult and hard thing to keep the right profeſsion of the Goſpel, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in times of oppoſition.</hi> It were needleſs to commend this unto Chriſtians, if it were not an hard work, to go on with it at ſuch a time. <hi>They all forſook him and fled, Mar.</hi> 14 50. When ſtorms were high, and perſecution hot, the Diſciples of Chriſt were offended<hi>:</hi> he whoſe profeſſion is but counterfeit will fall off quite, he whoſe profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in truth may be offended with Chriſt and his Goſpel. I note this for two reaſons. 1. That none might be too confident of themſelves<hi>:</hi> 2. That none be too cenſorious againſt thoſe who retreat and ſhrink in ſuch a time.</p>
               <p>

3. <hi>The excellency of perſeverance in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Goſpel.</hi> Its excellency, as in other reſpects ſo in this appears clearly, that its a mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in the day of temptation.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>What cauſe they have to bleſs God, who find ſuch Reſolutions wrought in their hearts.</hi> Theſe ſhooes are not onely their beauty, but their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>How beautiful are thy feet with ſhooes, O Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Daughter,</hi> Cant. 7. 1.</p>

                  <hi>arm themſelves with theſe Reſolutions.</hi> Get theſe ſhooes upon your feet, reſolve that whatever trouble come, whatſoever ſtorms ariſe, yet you will go through with your profeſſion, and never forſake it. It is neceſſary for thoſe that live in ſuch black dayes as theſe of ours are, to ſet themſelves to this work. The winds begin to grow loud, the skie is dark and lowring, perſecutions may come ſuddenly, and they are like to fall violently; its time to get, and neceſſary to keep theſe ſhooes on their feet. I ſhall lay down ſomething by way of Motives: ſomething by way of meanes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Mot. <hi>All the promiſes are made to them that perſevere.</hi> It is not he that beginneth, but he that continueth unto the end, that ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 22. When the even was come the Lord of the vineyard ſaith unto the Steward, Call the labourers and give them their hire, <hi>Math.</hi> 20. 8. <hi>Nemo coronatur ante quintum Actum.</hi> Be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the crown of life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10.

Perſecutions are called, <hi>the tryal of our faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. becauſe when a ſoul is under perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then it appears whether his profeſſion was gold or droſs. A temporary profeſſion is like the houſe built upon the ſand, it ſtood all the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, but when the winds blew, and the rain came, and the flouds lift up their voice, then it fell, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 24, 25, 26, 27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mot. <hi>Adhering to the profeſsion of the Goſpel in times of oppoſition, doth moſt of all honour the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.

It was no great thanks to <hi>David</hi> to fetch the Ark into the City of <hi>David,</hi> when it brought proſperity with it, v. 12. any one would entertain a proſperous Ark, but he that is a right Chriſtian will make room for it when it brings affliction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Mot. <hi>The Goſpel will abundantly recompence all their ſufferings.</hi> The Ark did make good ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to <hi>Obed Edom</hi> for taking it in in a boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous time, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 11. Its a Goſpel of comfort at every time, but never ſo full of comfort as in a time of affliction. <hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. The Goſpel is alwayes a Goſpel of peace, but the peace of it is moſt diſcovered in a time of trouble. He that forſaketh father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. for my ſake and the Goſpel, ſhall have an hundredfold in this world with perſecution,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170109:116"/>
and in the world to come everlaſting life, <hi>Math.</hi> 19. 29.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Mot. <hi>All the ſufferings which ariſe for the Goſpel are for this end, to try whether men will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it or no.</hi> There muſt be hereſies, that they which are approved may be made manifeſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Mot. <hi>Tis a priviledge to ſuffer for the Goſpel.</hi> Unto you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt, &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> All the elect are called to be believers, but not to be ſufferers: ſuffering for the Goſpel is in ſome reſpects a priviledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove beleiving the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Mot. <hi>He that is not willing to cleave to the Goſpel in a day of ſuffering, ſhall have no benefit by the Goſpel in the other world.</hi> He that will not ſuffer for it, ſhall not be ſaved by it, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 38.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Mot. <hi>He that is not willing to ſuffer for the Goſpel, ſhall ſuffer without the Goſpel,</hi> Mar. 8. 35.</p>
               <p>Thus much for motives.</p>
               <p>The Meanes or Directions are theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Study the excellency of the Goſpel.</hi> A thorough perfect knowledge of the Goſpel will make a Chriſtian reſolved to goe through with profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it whatſoever follow. <hi>Beza</hi> expounds the preparation of the Goſpel to be the knowledge of the Goſpel.

2. <hi>Learn perfectly that chriſtian Leſſon of ſelf-denial.</hi> This will make you cleave to the Goſpel in the worſt condition, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 24. He that knows not how to deny himſelf will be eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to deny the Goſpel, eſpecially when the croſs and the Goſpel go together, he may follow Chriſt when he can take up Chriſt and pleaſure, but he will never be able to take up the croſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be able to lay aſide himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Get your hearts above the world, and all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entanglements.</hi> No man that warreth intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth himſelf with the things of this life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. It is not poſſible to embrace the Goſpel and the world together, eſpecially when the world and the Goſpel are at variance <hi>Sell all thou haſt, and give to the poor, and follow me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to that young man, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 22, 23. <hi>Abiice terram, accipe Caelum?</hi> you know what the iſſue was, he went away ſorrowful, for he was very rich.

               <p>1. <hi>In regard of his own nature.</hi> He is made up of nothing but wickedneſs. God did at firſt create the Divels holy and righteous, as the other Angels which ſtill keep their habitations, but by their fall they have poyſoned their nature, and filled it ful of wickedneſs and impiety.

                  </gap> We uſe to paint the Devils black, to ſhew how black they have made their natures, which when they came out of Gods hand were ſo white, unſpotted and glorious.

               <p>2. <hi>In regard of his practiſe upon others.</hi> His great deſign is to draw men into ſin, and to keep them in wickedneſs. He goes about unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly compaſſing the earth to and fro, and all that he may tempt men to acts of wickedneſs. The Devil is the Author of all the wickedneſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170109:120"/>
which is committed in the world. He is a Liar, &amp; the father thereof, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. He is a Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and the Father thereof: he is a Blaſphemer, and the father thereof, &amp;c. All ſin hath its riſe from Satan, either in whole or in part.

He helps to harden the heart, and to blind the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to ſtupifie the conſcience, &amp;c. ſome way or other he hath a hand in all the wickedneſs which is done in the world. Tis true, the Devils contriving of ſin doth not excuſe the ſinner, for he doth give his conſent<hi>:</hi> Satan hath no power to force or compel the will, onely to perſwade by Arguments and temptations, &amp;c. <hi>Every man is tempted when he is drawn aſide of his own luſt and enticed, Jam.</hi> 1. 14.

The wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the Devils doth diſgrace all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies. Call a perſon by what name of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency you can, call him rich, call him learned, call him noble, call him a prudent man, yet if you ſay <hi>wicked,</hi> you lay all his excellencies in the duſt<hi>:</hi> Wickedneſs ſtains and ſoyls all the glory and beauty both of perſons and Nations. <hi>Naaman</hi> Captain of the Hoaſt of the King of <hi>Syria</hi> was a great man with his Maſter, &amp;c. but he was a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 5: 1. this one word marrs all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. To ſay, ſuch a one is a man of parts, a man
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170109:121"/>
of valour, a man of great eſtate, a man of deep knowledgde, but he is a wicked man, he is a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, a ſwearer, a lyar, a perfidious man, &amp;c. this one word doth unſay all his excellencies, and caſts a cloud upon all his glory.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That wicked men are of all Creatures the moſt like to the Devil.</hi> They have his image upon them, they have his nature, they bear his name; the Devil is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo is a wicked man. Holy men are like to God, they are called by his Name; God is holy, and they are holy, God is righteous, and they are righteous; but wicked men have the very name and the very nature of Satan; he is unholy, and ſo are they; and the more any perſon abounds in wickedneſs, the more like he grows ſtill to the Devil, who is wicked, and the father of wickedneſs: Its ſaid of <hi>Caein,</hi> that <hi>he was of that wicked one, and ſlew his brother,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3<hi>:</hi> 12. We may ſay ſo of every other ſinner: The ſwearer is of that wicked one, the prophane perſon is of that wicked one, &amp;c. <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the Devil,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. he is of him, not onely as he is tempted by him, but becauſe he doth ſimbolize with him in nature, he hath his character and image printed upon his ſoul.</p>
               <p>3, <hi>That Hell muſt needs be a wicked place.</hi> All the Inhabitants of it are wicked: There are none there but wicked Angels, and wicked men, and all the work which is done there is nothing but wickedneſs, therefore it muſt of neceſſity be a wicked place: Hell is a place of torment as well as of ſin; <hi>I am tormented in theſe flames:</hi> but the wickedneſs of Hell is worſe than the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170109:121"/>
torments of Hell, its the wickedneſs of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and of men acted by Devils, that bring them to that place of torments. A Hell of torments is rather to be choſen than a Hell of wickedneſs<hi>:</hi> It was <hi>Anſelms</hi> ſpeech; <hi>If hell,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were on one hand without ſin, and ſin on the other hand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hell, and I muſt needs chuſe one, I would rather chuſe hell than ſin.</hi> A hell of torments without ſin, is better than a hell of ſin without tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>That thoſe that are under the Devils power are in a very ſad condition.</hi> Its a ſad thing to be under the command of wicked Governours, <hi>Prov,</hi> 28. 15. <hi>As a roaring Lion and a ranging Bear, ſo is a wicked Ruler over the poor people.</hi> It were as good to live in the wilderneſs amongſt ravening Lions, as under the Dominion of wicked Rulers: wickedneſs fits them for all acts of oppreſſion, injuſtice and cruelty: When children that want knowledge, and babes which are without underſtanding rule, then <hi>the people ſhall be oppreſſed every one by another, Eſay</hi> 3. 5. how much more when wicked men rule: when wickedneſs ſits at the helm, there will be no want of miſery in the ſhip. <hi>That the hypocrite reign not, leſt the people be inſnared, Job</hi> 34: 30. people muſt expect nothing but ſnares, till the reign of the hypocrite be expired<hi>: Solomon</hi> tell us, that <hi>when the wicked bear rule, the people mourn, Prov.</hi> 29: 2. All in a Land are mourners in ſuch a time, unleſs it be thoſe that live by wickedneſs. If it be ſo ſad to be under the power of wicked men, how ſad is it to be under the power of Satan? there is more wickedneſs in one Devil than in many
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170109:122"/>
wicked men put together<hi>:</hi> And then he hath more power and policy than men have to bring to paſs the wickedneſs that is in him; therefore is the condition of all to be lamented that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his juriſdiction; and thus are all wicked and unregenate men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>This ſhewes us why it is, that Satan doth ſo hate God and all his Saints:</hi> He is an irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Adverſary to God and to all that are godly. The reaſon is plain, there is a contrariety of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture between God and Satan, and between Satan and godly ones, and where there is contrariety of nature, there will be enmity and oppoſition. <hi>Gal:</hi> 5: 17<hi>: The righteous is an abomination to the wicked.</hi>

It was <hi>Davids</hi> Argument, whereby he was ſtayed from laying hands upon King <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was earneſtly perſwaded to kill him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 13. <hi>Wickedneſs proceedeth from the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but my hand ſhall not be upon thee.</hi> Wicked acts are diabolical acts, they proceed from him, and they lead men to him. And it is not fit, that the Children of God ſhould ſymbolize with the Devil. Tis the Apoſtles Argument to take off the people of God from Idol-worſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>The things which the Gentiles ſacrifice they ſacrifice to Devils and not to God, and I would not that ye ſhould have fellowſhip with Devils.</hi> Swearing, lying, forſwearing, cheating, &amp;c. theſe are works fit for the evil one and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170109:122"/>
and not for Saints. Be not therefore parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with them.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Bleſs God for delivering you from under the power and dominion of Satan.</hi> Vide <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. You were once at the command of that wicked one as well as others, and you ſhould have continued for ever in that condition, if God had not freed you from his tyranny. <hi>David</hi> praiſeth God for cutting aſunder the cords of wicked men, in which he was ſometimes holden, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 129. 4. <hi>The plowers plowed upon my back, and made long their furrows: but the righteous Lord,</hi> &amp;c. How much more cauſe have you to praiſe God for deliverance from wicked Devils, who had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not onely to miſchief your bodies, but your ſouls alſo?</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Do not truſt the Devll when he pretends to ſanctifie.</hi> He is ſo politique, that he can ſometimes for his advantage transform himſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>Myſtery Babylon</hi> hath in her hand <hi>a golden cup,</hi> full of abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and filthineſs of her fornication. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 4. The Devil, the grand Impoſter of all, doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times carry his worſt poyſon in a golden cup, he can ſpeak Scripture to draw you from Scripture, he can tempt you to be irreligious, by religious Arguments falſly and deceitfully applied; he can tempt men to prophane Sabbaths, upon a pretence of ſtanding for Chriſtian liberty, &amp;c. he can argue men from waiting upon Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe the Spirit is able to teach them, &amp;c. This is his great maſter-piece that he is now act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the world, his wine is now carried in a golden cup. But let all the godly know, that he
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170109:123"/>
is ſtill the wicked one, and though he ſpeak di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely, yet he alwayes acts diabolically; though the voice be <hi>Jacobs</hi> voice, yet the hands are the hands of <hi>Eſau;</hi> he never works more wickedly, than when he ſeems to act moſt holily.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the firſt propoſition.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That the temptations of Satan are fiery darts.</hi> He ſhoots arrows of fire at the Servants of God. Its ſometimes true in the very letter; the Devil uſeth fire to deſtroy the Servants of God. The Apoſtle mentions the fiery tryal, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4<hi>:</hi> 12. <hi>Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery tryal, as if ſome ſtrange thing happened to you: i. e.</hi> fiery perſecutions. The Devil ſometimes ſtirreth up Tyrants by material fire to devour the bodies of Gods Saints. The three Children were caſt in a fiery furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 21. And we read of ſome Chriſtians, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 34. that quenched the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the fire. In the primitive time fiery perſecutions were raiſed againſt the Chriſtians. And in the <hi>Marian</hi> dayes, many of Gods Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes went to Heaven in fiery Chariots, they gave their bodies to be burned, that they might not worſhip any God but their own God. And we do not know whether the ſame kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions may not yet ariſe amongſt us in our dayes; we dwell amongſt the children of men, who are ſet on fire, whoſe teeth are ſpears and arrows, and their tongue a ſharp ſword, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 37: 4. And if theſe fiery perſecutions ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, God would deal no otherwiſe with us than he hath done with his former Servants, who through faith have triumphed in theſe flames. But the Apoſtle, I ſuppoſe, doth not here ſpeak
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170109:123"/>
of perſecutions, but of other temptations. He alludes to the cuſtom of Souldiers in former times, who uſed to dip the heads of their Arrows in poyſon, and ſo ſhooting them at their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies fired their fleſh. Satans temptations are here compared to theſe fiery darts.</p>
               <p>In the handling of it I ſhall firſt ſhew you, why his temptations are called fiery Arrows. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhall make ſome inferences from it by way of uſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are called fiery darts in theſe two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>For the dreadfulneſs and terrour of them.</hi> Fire is a very terrifying thing, it works much aſtoniſhment and fear upon the hearts of men that behold it. To ſee Houſes or Cities ſet on fire works great amazement upon the Spirits of men. the temptations of Satan are dreadful temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſuch as have the right apprehenſion of them. Sometimes he tempts men to deny Jeſus Chriſt that bought them. Sometimes he tempts them to blaſpheme God: Sometimes to ſelf-murther, <note place="margin">Math. 26. 70. Job 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 6. Sometimes to caſt off Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as a vain thing. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 73: 13. Theſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as they are dreadful in their own nature, ſo they work much trouble and amazement in the Spirits of them that are thus aſſaulted, tis a dreadful thing to have ſuch a ſuggeſtion, though it be never conſented unto by the heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>For the deſtructiveneſs of them.</hi> Fire is a very devouring creature<hi>: Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the adjoyning Cities were in a few houres conſumed to aſhes by the violence of fire, <hi>Gen.</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:170109:124"/>
19. 24, 25. The temptations of Satan are waſting things. All the comfort of a Chriſtian is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoured by them. The ſtrength of the body is decayed, the ſtrength of the ſpirits is waſted, and the whole man is brought very low, and made like withered graſs by the violent ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe flames. The temptations of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which God ſends upon his people for their trial, do much waſt both ſoul and body<hi>: Job</hi> 6<hi>:</hi> 4. <hi>The arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poiſon wherof drinketh up my ſpirits.</hi> And ſo do the temptations of Satan<hi>:</hi> One hours temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on drinks up more ſpirits than many weeks ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 88: 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Inferences by way of uſe are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Such as are under theſe burning flames ſtand in much need of your pitty and prayers.</hi> Perſons that are in a houſe ſet on fire are objects of pitty in all mens thoughts, every one is ſenſible of ſuch a ſad condition. Such as lie under temptations are in a worſe condition, their ſouls are ſet on fire, did you but feel their burnings, you would pitty them. The caſe of the Iſraelites was ſad, when God ſent fiery Serpents to bite them, <hi>Exod</hi> 21: 6. Tempted Chriſtians are haunted with fiery Serpents worſe than thoſe, let them be relei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with your counſel and Prayers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Be not too cenſorious againſt thoſe that are overcome by Satans temptations.</hi> Be not over ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere againſt ſuch.

faith. 1. Hiſtorical faith is the knowledge and beleef of the truth of divine Revelations upon the teſtimony of God himſelf. Of this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 19. This faith was in <hi>Simon Magus, Acts</hi> 8. 13. 2. The faith of Miracles, is a ſpecial gift of bringing to paſs ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry work or foretelling ſome certain event by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20. 3. Temporary faith, is an aſſent unto the Doctrine of the Scriptures, accompanied with the external profeſſion thereof, and ſome kind of joy in the knowledge thereof for a time, <hi>vide Mat.</hi> 13. 20, 21. Of this faith the Apoſtle ſpeaks when he ſaith that <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus</hi> have overthrown the faith of ſome, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 18. 4. Juſtifying and ſaving faith, of which the text ſpeaks, the great effect of it doth clearly evince it to be a faith of the beſt kind, for no other faith beſides juſtifying, can quench the fiery darts of Satan. Now in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the nature of this grace I ſhall do two things. 1. I ſhall give you a diſcription of it. 2. I ſhall ſhew the ſeveral ſteps or degrees of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Diſcription of it; I ſhall give it thus. Saving faith is a ſupernatural ſpecial gift of grace, wrought in the heart of an elect perſon by the ſpirit of God, through the preaching of the word of the Goſpel, whereby he is enabled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that Jeſus Chriſt is not onely the Saviour of the World, but his Saviour, and thereupon caſt himſelf upon him for life and ſalvation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the promiſe. I ſhall open this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Tis a a gift of grace, Eph.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 27. He helped them much who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170109:126"/>
through grace. 1. The firſt preparing of the heart to it. 2. The firſt plantation of it, the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the habit. 3. The means whereby it is wrought. 4. The preſervation and continuance of it, all theſe are of grace. Faith is a part of the new Creature, the great and chief part of it, and the new Creature is meerly of garce. Tis called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>a mans own faith</hi> ſubjective, but effective, originaliter, tis meerly of grace, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. The faith of the operation of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Tis a ſpecial ſupernatural gift.</hi> This doth diſtinguiſh it from all other kinds of faith, and all other common gifts, which are beſtowed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly upon men by the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. Tis an evtraordinary gift afforded unto none but ſpecial favourites.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Tis wrought in the heart of an elect perſon.</hi> Tis beſtowed onely upon the elect. Here the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls it the faith of Gods Elect, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1. Ye beleeve not becauſe ye are not of my Sheep, <hi>John</hi> 10. 26. And then tis wrought in the heart<hi>:</hi> the Scripture makes the herrt or will to be the ſeat of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. With the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs. The will rather than the underſtanding is the ſubject of faith, becauſe faith is an act of Election whereby the ſoul chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt. Now election is more than an act of the underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Tis wrought by the ſpirit of God through the preaching of the Goſpel.</hi> This ſets out both the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe, and the inſtrumental cauſe. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe is the Holy Ghoſt, not excluding the Father and the Son, for <hi>Opera Tunilatis ad extra ſunt indiviſa,</hi> but the Holy Ghoſt is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170109:126"/>
worker of it; the Father and Son work this and all other graces by the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called <hi>The ſpirit of faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. And the Spirit works it powerfully, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing and ſtirring up the ſoul to believe by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſwaſion only, but by an Almighty ſtrength creating ſuch an habit in the heart. The Apoſtle therfore mentions the ſame power for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of faith, which raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19. And then the miniſtry of the Goſpel, thats the inſtrumental cauſe, <hi>Rom</hi> 10. 17. called therefore the word of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. Faith is therefore called the fruit of the lips, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 19. And we ſhall do well to take notice of this, that the Apoſtle makes it to be the word preached by a lawful inſtituted Miniſtry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. Its not the preaching of men that run upon their own account, but of ſuch as are lawfully ſent to preach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Whereby he is perſwaded that Juſus Chriſt is not onely the Saviour of the World, but his Saviour alſo.</hi> Faith muſt have not only have a general beleef, but a particular application alſo. The juſt ſhall live by <hi>his</hi> faith. Who loved me and gave himſelf for me.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>And thereupon casts himſelf upon Chriſt for life and ſalvation according to the promiſe.</hi> This ſhews the very nature of faith. Tis Recumbency upon Chriſt. Tis cleaving to God with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. Tis the caſting of our burden upon Chriſt. Tis coming to Chriſt as to a living Stone. Faith is nothing elſe but the ſouls venturing it ſelf upon Chriſt according to the promiſe. This I ad <hi>according to the promiſe,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170109:127"/>
true faith, from falſe preſumption.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſeveral ſteps or degrees of this grace. I ſhall give you that in ſix particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Tis impoſſible that there ſhould be faith in Chriſt, or in any thing propounded by God, till there be the Knowledge of it. Tis true knowledge is not faith; they are two ſeveral di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct habits, yet it neceſſarily preceeds faith. Faith is the ſight of the mind, now ſight preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a viſible object. The Apoſtle makes it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to beleeve where knowledge is not, <hi>Ro.</hi> 10. 14. How ſhall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard? there is a knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed which followes faith, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 16. <hi>We have known and beleeved the love that God hath to us.</hi> Faith is called knowledge, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 11. Faith is an <note place="margin">Cognovenius credendo Calvin.</note> adviſed grace, it will not ruſh headlong into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known paths, when Chriſt asks the man when he had reſtored to his ſight, whether he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve on the Son of God, he anſwered that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with another, <hi>Who is he Lord that I might beleeve on him? John</hi> 9. 35, 36, 37, 38. and when he knew the perſon, then he both beleeved and worſhiped him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Aſſent.</hi> After the knowledge of the thing propounded is wrought in the underſtanding, then followeth the Act of the Will giving an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto that which is known, <hi>John</hi> 3. 33. This ſetting to of the ſeal, is nothing elſe but the firm aſſent of the ſoul unto the truth revealed, that Gods Teſtimony is true in every thing, to which it gives witneſs. This is that which is recorded of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15. 6. <hi>He beleeved in the Lord, i. e.</hi> he did freely yeild his aſſent to the truth, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170109:127"/>
ſtability of all that which God had delivered to him. Now this aſſent is 1. General and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to all the declarations of God. 2. Tis build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed properly and principally upon the Authority of God who hath revealed it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Upon this Aſſent is raiſed in the ſoul a ſtrong affection unto, and a high eſteem of all the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and diſcovery made by God. <hi>Appreciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> unto you who beleeve he is precious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. The ſoul ſurveyeth all thoſe things declared in the word with a very judicious eye, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth meanly of all other things in compariſon of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Upon this prizing of theſe things followeth a very earneſt longing and deſire in the ſoul to be made pertaker of all thoſe precious excellencies. Deſire of enjoying doth naturally follow affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: this deſire is unſatiable, unquenchable. Hence it is ſet out by hungring and thirſting, <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</hi> 55. 1. Hunger and thirſt, cannot be ſatisfied without the enjoyment of meat and drink.</p>
               <p n="5">4. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Deſire followeth Affiance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</hi> The ſoul is ſo wrought upon that it can come to Chriſt as a living Stone, and upon him and the promiſe of grace and pardon made in him is enabled to ſet down its reſt as upon the onely pillar of ſalvation. This is that which the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt calls the fixing of the heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 7, 8. It imports a ſecure and ſettled reſting upon God. The Prophet calls it ſtaying a mans ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 3. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee. David</hi> calls it Rolling our way upon the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 7. tis agreeable to that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:170109:128"/>
6. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this followeth the ſouls Election and choice of that which is held ont in the Divine Revelation.</hi> The ſoul doth freely and ſpontaneouſly chuſe the promiſes of the Goſpel, and makes them his own. This is one of the higheſt ſteps of faith, when the ſoul is not onely willing to accept but to chuſe the way of truth, and to chuſe all the contents of the promiſe. This is that which <hi>David</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 30, 31. <hi>I have choſen the way of truth, thy judgements have I laid before me. I have ſtuck unto thy Teſtimonies, O Lord, put me not to ſhame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Wherein lies the compariſon between faith and a ſhield?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith is like a ſhield for the ſtrength of it.</hi> Of all the parts of Armour which the Souldier wears the Shield was the ſtrongeſt. <hi>Polybius</hi> tels <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hiſtorian, li.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 467.</note> us the manner of it. It was made of a double board glewed ſtrongly together, it had a double cover, one of ſtrong linnen cloth, another of raw Neats leather, that it might quench the fiery Arrowes of the enemy when they hit upon it; about the edges of it above and beneath there went a ſtrong plate of Iron, that it might not be cut above with the edge of the enemies ſword, and that it might not rot below with hanging upon the ground, on the outſide of it there was a ſtrong boſſe of Iron which they called <hi>the umbo,</hi> to preſerve it from being battered with ſtones, ſpears, and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent weapons. Faith is the ſtrongeſt of all the graces; it is impenetrable and impregnable. You read of the power of faith, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 11. The faith of miracles is of ſuch ſtrength, that it doth pluck up mountaines by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oots, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170109:128"/>
Saving faith muſt needs be much more ſtrong.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Faith is a ſhhield for largeneſs.</hi> The Roman ſhield did cover the whole body. <hi>Polybius</hi> tels us that it was two foot and a half broad, and above four foot in length, ſo that he that could skilfully <note place="margin">Polyb. ut ſupra.</note> handle the ſhield might be ſafegarded on every part. Tis called in Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a gate or door, becauſe of the largeneſs of it. Faith is a very large grace, of a great extent. It covers the head and the heart, and the feet, and the body, &amp;c. He that can but handle this ſhield of faith after a right manner, may lye ſafe in the midſt of the hotteſt temptations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Why we muſt take this above all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe this grace is that which Strengthens and Acts all the other.</hi> The ſhield hath this excellency in it, that it doth protect not onely the body of the ſouldier more than any other piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, but alſo that it doth defend all the reſt. It is <hi>Armatura armaturae,</hi> If any violence be offered to the head the ſhield is lifted upto defend that piece, if the head piece be either cracked or knockt off, the ſhield ſupplies the place of the head piece; if the breaſt-plate be broken, the ſhield ſupplies the man of a breaſt-plate; if the girdle be ſlipt off, the ſhield ſupplies the place of the girdle; if the ſhooes be rent, the ſhield is inſtead of ſhooes, its a lifeguard to every part of the Armour, he that hath a ſhield hath double harneſs. The grace of faith is that which gives ſtrength to all other graces. The Doctrine of truth will not hold out one combate if the grace of faith be not implied, it is the grace of faith which ſtrengthens the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith. The breaſtplate of righteouſneſs
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170109:129"/>
wil ſoon bepierced if it be not ſecured by the ſhield of faith, faith is the preſerver and the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of righteouſneſs, the ſhooes of reſolution will ſoon wear away, if they be not ſoaled with faith, its faith that mainteines courage and whets reſolution. Hope will ſoon go out if it be not fed with faith, if faith faile, hope gives up the ghoſt, hope expects what faith beleeves, and if faith langiſh hope withereth, hope is the flame of faith, and if the fire of faith be put out, the flame of hope is exringuiſhed. The ſword of the ſpirit, the word of God is as a ſword without an edge, if faith do not ſharpen it. The word preached did not profit ſaith the Apoſtle, becauſe it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. Faith is that which puls the ſword out of the ſcabberd. The word of God without faith, is like a ſword lockt up in the ſcabbard, its like a ſword in the hand of a Child, but the word in the hand of faith, is like a ſword in the hand of a Gyant. Prayer without faith is ineffectual, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 6. It hath no promiſe of acceptance with God. Whatſoever ye ask in prayer, beleeve that you have it, and you ſhall receive it, <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 24. Prayer without faith, is like dead Phyſick: tis faith that is the ſoul and life of prayer. As all the Stars have the light from the Sun, though they have ſome kind of natural light in themſelves; ſo the grace of faith hath an influence upon all the other pieces of the ſpiritual Armour, both for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and their quickning. And therefore faith is ſometimes put for all the ſtrentgh of a Chriſtian. <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy faith do not faile, Luke</hi> 22. 32. If faith faile all fails, and if faith hold all holds.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:170109:129"/>
4. How the grace of faith quencheth the fiery temptations of Satan. I ſhall ſhew it in two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Faith quencheth Temptations by removing out of the ſoul that which keepes Temptations burning.</hi> Sin and corruption in the ſoul is that fewel which fires Satans temptations, the luſts of our own hearts keep theſe temptations flaming in the ſoul. Now faith is a purifier, it takes away all the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs which keeps temptatiuns alive, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. There are three things which concur to the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the ſoul. 1. The efficient cauſe, this is the ſpirit of God, who is therefore called the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſanctification and holineſs, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 13. 2. The meritorius cauſe, this is the laver of Chriſts blood. 3. The inſtrumental cauſe, this is faith; Faith is the branch of Hyſop which was to be dipped in the blood of purification, for the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of him that was unclean, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14. 6. There are many wayes whereby faith cleanſeth the heart. 1. Faith cleanſeth as it takes hold upon the promiſe of ſanctification. The promiſe <hi>Ezech,</hi> 36. 25. Now faith is that grace which works this promiſe ſo as to bring cleanſing out of it; Faith ſucks cleanſing out of this promiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith purifieth as it brings the word of God home effectually and powerfully to the ſoul. The word of God hath a cleanſing vertue, <hi>John</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Now ye are clean through the word I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to you.</hi> Faith applies this cleanſing word to the ſoul, and ſo purifieth. 3. Faith purifieth in that it makes all other ordinances effectual for our cleanſing, as Sacraments, Prayer, neither the blood of Chriſt in baptiſme, nor the Supper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170109:130"/>
purgative without faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. Let us draw near in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Faith cleanſeth as it ſets other graces a work in the ſoul; Love, fear, humility, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp;c. are made operatively the grace of faith, Faith is as the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> which by its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſets all other graces a moving, <hi>vide Heb.</hi> 11. We read there how by faith all other graces were made operative. Faith ſets <hi>Noahs</hi> fear, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> obedience, <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſelf-denial, &amp;c. a working. Faith puts the ſoul upon praying, repenting, examining, &amp;c. all which have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to purification. 5. Faith cleanſeth as it ſtrengthens the ſouls union with Jeſus Chriſt. The ſoul is purified by union with Chriſt, now its the work of faith to incorporate the ſoul further into this root. Faith ſhewes the ſoul more and more of the glory of Chriſt, and ſo transforms us into the ſame Image from glory to glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>

Faith fetcheth to the ſoul the water of the well of <hi>Bethelem</hi> which is by the gate, and pours that upon the fiery darts; the blood of Chriſts Croſſe will quench all the wild fire of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this faith brings. 2. Faith brings to the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170109:130"/>
ſoul the merit of Chriſts Interceſſion which he makes continually for his people at Gods right hand. <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not, Luke</hi> 22. 32. Faith interpoſeth this botween the ſoul and the fiery darts, and ſo puts them out. 3. Faith brings to the ſoul the promiſes of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors which God hath made to his people over their temptations.

I ſhall onely keep to the Doctrine, its the ſouls ſhield whereby it is defended in time of Temptation, whereby all the venimous Arrows
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170109:131"/>
of Satan are extinguiſhed and put out. He that wants faith is weak, blind, lame, dead, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>This lets us ſee why it is that Satan prevailes ſo much in the world.</hi> All men ſaith the Apoſtle have not faith, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 2. Moſt men fight without a ſhield, and ſo lye open to Satans darts. Hypocrites they are overcome for want of the girdle; vicious perſons are vanquiſhed for want of the breaſtplate; weak hearted perſons are put to the worſe for want of the ſhooes; and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers fall in battel for want of the ſhield. There are ſo few conquerours, becauſe there are ſo few beleevers. <hi>When the Son of man commeth ſhall he find faith in the erath? Luke</hi> 18. 8. Our Saviour ſpeaks there of Chriſts coming in this life to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and deliver his elect, the earth ſhall be ſo low and deliverance ſhall be ſo improfitable that the report of it will not be beleeved. as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in former time, had not faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve their deliverance from Captivity, <hi>Iſa</hi> 63. 1. 2. So ſhall it be ſaith our Saviour when Chriſt comes to avenge his afflicted people under the Goſpel that cry unto him. And if there be ſo few that can beleeve a temporal deliverance, how few are there that can beleeve for the ſaving of their ſouls? No wonder then if Satan overcome ſo many.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>How needful it is for the Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to be often preaching about the Doctrine of faith.</hi> Thoſe weapons and poſtures which are of greateſt uſe to the Souldier, the Captain ought to be moſt diligent in inſtructing the Souldier in them. The Miniſters of the Goſpel are the Captains of the Lords Hoſt, they are to train and exerciſe all the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170109:132"/>
ſpiritual Souldiers of Chriſt, they are to teach them the uſe of their Arms, and all their poſtures, that they may be deetrous in the day of battel. If any Souldier be wounded for want of arms, or of skil to uſe them through their default, God wil require it at their hands. Now of all the pieces of ſpirituall Armour, the ſhield of faith is the moſt neceſſary, and therefore the Doctrine of faith ſhould be moſt frequently preached.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>This ſhewes what neceſſarily lies upon the ſons of men to prove and examine the truth of their faith.</hi> If the ſhield of faith be rotten or counterfeit the ſoul is undone in the day of Temptation, if the ſhield of faith be ſound, and armour of proof, the ſtrongeſt aſſaults of Satan will be repelled with comfort. <hi>Prove your ſelves whether you be in the faith or no,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. Tis neceſſary to try 1. Becauſe there is not a man in the world which hath heard of Jeſus Chriſt, but thinks he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves in him. To be accounted an Infidell or unbeleever is a matter of ſuch reproach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, as that no man is willing to lye under it. 2. Becauſe the heart is very deceitful, and in nothing more ſubject to be miſtaken than in this caſe. There is a falſe preſumption and fooliſh fancy, which would gladly be called by the name of faith, <hi>John.</hi> 2. 23. 24. <hi>When Jeſus was at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem many beleeved in his name, when they ſawthe miracles wch</hi> 
                     <hi>he did; but Jeſus did not commit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto them, becauſe he knew all men.</hi> They did preſume that they beleeved in Chriſt, but Jeſus Chriſt knew their faith was nothing elſe but a meer fancy and groundleſs preſumption. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170109:132"/>
the Devil uſeth all the skill he can to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſinner, and to make him confident that he doth beleive; as he endeavours to perſwade the true Beleiver, that his fruit is rotten, ſo he endeavours to perſwade the unbeleiver, that his preſumption is faith.</p>
                  <p>That I may help them in this inquiry I ſhall do two things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Diſcover ſome miſtaken grounds which men go upon, thinking that to be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſaving faith, which is not ſo.</item>
                     <item>2. Lay down ſome poſitive evidences of true faith.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. There are two great miſtakes about faith, by which many are deceived: <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Some are deceived in regard of knowledge and aſſent. They think they have true juſtifying faith, becauſe they have the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and give, as they think, a right aſſent to the ſame: for the removal of this miſtake I ſhall firſt ſhew, that both theſe may be without ſaving faith. Secondly I ſhall ſhew, how the knowledge of an unbeleiver and his aſſent differ from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and aſſent of true faith.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>That Knowledge and Aſſent is not faith.</hi> Tis granted, that there is no faith truely wrought without Knowledge and Aſſent, but that there may be Knowledge and ſome Aſſent where ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith is not, appears by theſe two reaſons. 1. The moſt wicked and prophane perſons in the world may have, and many times do attain unto a more exact knowledge of the Doctrine of the Scriptures, than many a true Beleiver: And they may alſo aſſent unto thoſe truths. The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170109:133"/>
Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome by way of ſuppoſition, that may underſtand all myſteries, and have all knowledge, and yet want ſaving faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2. All this is but an hiſtorical faith. <hi>Judas</hi> had the knowledge of the Scriptures, and gave aſſent to them; he preached the Goſpel to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and yet wanted faith, <hi>John</hi> 6. 64. There are ſome of you that beleive not<hi>:</hi> you know what will be the plea of many in the latter day, <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 22. and yet had not one drachm of ſaving faith. I ſhall deſire you to peruſe but that one Scripture well, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. and then you will conclude, that neither the knowledge of, nor the aſſenting to the doctrine of the Scriptures is ſaving faith, but are ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily without it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The very Devils themſelves are beyond the moſt intelligent Chriſtians in all matters of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> They know the hiſtory of the Bible more exactly than we. Satan was not ignorant of Scripture when he ſet upon our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 6. And the Devil alſo gives aſſent to the truth of the Scriptures, <hi>Jam</hi> 2. 19. He acknowledged Chriſt to be the Son of God, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>What have we to do with thee Jeſus thou Son of God:</hi> as full a confeſſion for the matter and ſubſtance of it, as that which <hi>Peter</hi> made, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the living God.</hi> Now that which is fained in the worſt of men, and in the very Devils, can neither be true faith, nor an evidence of it.</p>
                  <p>2. If we come to examine that knowledge and aſſent which is in wicked men with that which is in a true beleiver, we ſhall find a vaſt difference; for 1. concerning their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170109:133"/>
there are three differences.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The knowledge of a true Beleiver is an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentall knowledge, but the knowledge of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleiver is meerly notional and ſpeculative.</hi> A Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver hath in his heart a lively ſenſe and feeling of all thoſe truths which he hath the knowledge of in his underſtanding. They are truths in his heart as well as in his head. That promiſe of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>I will put my Law in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and write it in their hearts;</hi> is made good to every true Beleiver, and to him alone. His heart is an Index or Commentary, by which, through the Spirit of God, he can underſtand divine truths, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Ye are manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the epiſtle of Chriſt miniſtred by us, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of ſtone, but in the fleſhy tables of the heart</hi> This is the meaning of that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>John</hi> 7. 16, 17. <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The knowledge of faith is a practical tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming knowledge.</hi> His knowledge is diffuſed into every ſtep of his life into every action; his life is reformed by his knowledge, and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the truths of God; whereas the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an unbeleiver neither changeth his heart nor life, except it be from evill to worſe, his knowledge puffeth him up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. it makes him more proud and more ſenſual. Its ſaid of the Heathen, that they retained nor God in their knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. but became vain in their imaginations, the one hath onely the form of knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 20. the other
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170109:134"/>
hath not onely the form, but the power and the life alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The knowledge of faith is a knowledge which raiſes the heart nearer to God</hi> The knowledge of a Beleiver crucifieth the world unto him, and him unto the world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. <hi>vide Phil.</hi> 3. 8. 10. whereas the knowledge of an unbeleiver bows down his ſoul nearer the earth.</p>
                  <p>2. Concerning the aſſent of an unbeleiver, it differs from the aſſent of true faith thus.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The aſſent of faith is a chearful aſſent. Its free.</hi> But the aſſent of an unbeleiver is without joy. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>The devils beleive and tremble,</hi> ſo do the unbeleiver, at leaſt, concerning ſome truths.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>The aſſent of faith is univerſal.</hi> So is not the aſſent of an unbeleiver, at leaſt his chearful aſſent.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome truths in the Scripture which threaten ruine and deſtruction to all in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, theſe he cannot aſſent to, at leaſt joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome truths, which call him to the practiſe of ſuch things which he hath no affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to; the crucifying of ſin, the mortifying of corruptions, cutting off the right hand, &amp;c. he had rather theſe were not truths than real truths, he hath ſecret wiſhes, that theſe truths were either raced out, or elſe that they had been propounded with a greater latitude.</p>
                  <p>2. Miſtake is about Application. He that can truly apply Chriſt to himſelf, hath true faith in Chriſt, for this is the <hi>Ratio formalis,</hi> the ſpecial act of faith. Now many an unbeleiver thinks he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170109:134"/>
can apply Chriſt as well as any other. Thoſe in <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 25, 26 come to Chriſt with much ſeeming confidence, as if they had been of intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, <hi>Lord, Lord, open to us,</hi> and yet never had ſaving faith in him.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall here ſhew a threefold difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Application of a Beleiver and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleiver.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Application of ſaving faith is from ſomething of Chriſt wrought ſavingly within him.</hi> He finds the Image of Chriſt in him, he hath well grounded hopes of it, and therefore applies Chriſt to him<hi>:</hi> As <hi>Thomas,</hi> in another caſe, ſees the print of the nails, and then ſaith, <hi>My Lord and my God;</hi> So a true Beleiver ſees upon his ſoul the print of the nails, the dyings of the Lord Jeſus, the Characters of his death, burial, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and therefore applies him to himſelf. Whereas the application of Chriſt, made by an unbeleiver, is meerly from that diſcovery which is made of Chriſt in the Scripture, and not from any intrinſecal worth which he finds upon his own heart: <hi>vide Galat.</hi> 2 20. there you have <hi>Pauls</hi> application; <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me,</hi> &amp;c. What ground can you ſhew within you why Chriſt is yours?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Application of ſaving faith is alwayes agreeable to the tenor of the Promiſe and Covenant wherein Chriſt is held forth.</hi> Vide <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, 26, 27. Faith applies the grace of Chriſt as well as the merit of Chriſt, applies Chriſt for ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as well as for juſtification, applies the water as well as the bloud; the application which an unbeleiver makes is onely or chiefly of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170109:135"/>
the comforts and of the purchaſe of Chriſt, &amp;c. he applies the Merit of Chriſt, not the Spirit of Chriſt, the Promiſes, not the Commands, &amp;c. whereas true faith applies him univerſally, his Kingly and Prophetical Office, as well as his Prieſtly: <hi>vide Phil.</hi> 3. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Application of faith is alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſelf-Reſignation.</hi> The true Beleiver doth as chearfully ſurrender himſelf to Chriſt, as applies Chriſt to himſelf. So did the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. he would not onely apprehend, but be apprehended: And ſo the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his:</hi> He doth not onely apply the ſin offering, but he offers alſo the burnt Offering. The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. would have Chriſtians to yeeld themſelves to God, &amp;c. The unbeleiver he onely applies Chriſt to himſelf, he doth not voluntarily yeeld himſelf to Chriſt, he doth not dedicate himſelf to Chriſt by holineſs and obedience.</p>
                  <p>2. I ſhall now give ſome poſitive evidences of true faith. I ſhall ground them upon ſeveral places of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>1. That of the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying your hearts by faith.</hi> Heart purity is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary concomitant and conſequence of ſaving faith. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is made unto us of God, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. If by faith thou haſt Chriſt for thy righteouſneſs, he is alſo thy ſanctification. He whoſe heart is unpurified, is deſtitute of the grace of faith.</p>
                  <p>Now the purification of the heart may be known by theſe five evidences.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:170109:135"/>
1. <hi>A purified heart is a heart that truly bewails all pollutions and impurities.</hi> The moſt clean heart hath ſome pollution unmortified, but he hath no defilement unlamented, his ſtains, and ſores, and ſpots are his greateſt burthen, his heavieſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. <hi>Pauls</hi> body of death put him to more grief than all the troubles which befel him in his whole life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23, 24. Is it ſo with thee? Doſt thou bewail the uncleanneſs of thy heart cordially, ſadly, ſecretly? Thou wouldeſt gladly be delivered from it? Thou canſt neither eat, nor drink, nor ſleep quietly with it? The impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thy heart turns thy ſweetneſſes into bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe? This is certainly an effect of true faith. <hi>Vide Zech.</hi> 12. 10. Looking upon Chriſt is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiving in him, this beleiving is expreſſed by ſorrowing. And if thou wouldeſt in truth be rid of thy corruptions, thou wilt then diligently make uſe of all meanes, be they never ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, never ſo coſtly, that may cleanſe them away.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A purified heart will kindly accept of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproof for his impurity, or any advice that may make him clean.</hi> He will love a perſon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all his life for any faithful rebuke or counſel. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 141. 5. <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David</hi> ſhews the purity of his heart, by his accepting the rebukes of <hi>Abigail,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 32, 33. A heart that is purified is beſt pleaſed with that Sermon that comes cloſeſt to his conſcience; he would have all his heart diſcovered to himſelf. <hi>Hide nothing from me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eli</hi> to <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 17. Yea, he begs that God would ſearch his heart for him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 139.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170109:136"/>
23, 24. Whereas a heart that is unclean cares not to have any ſpot diſcovered; he either open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flies in the face, or elſe ſecretly hates any that makes his ſin known to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A purified heart both loves others for their purity, and endeavours as far as he can to make others pure.</hi> He loves purity in an enemy, and his deſire is, that all others might be made pure, and that out of love to God and to purity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>A heart purified will be very cautious of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing it ſelf.</hi> It is exceeding fearful of ſtepping aſide; he will very carefully pick every ſtep of his way that he may not be polluted. <hi>I have made a covenant with mine eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Word of Exhortation. I ſhall direct this, 1. To all thoſe who have this ſhield of faith, to them I have two things to ſay. 2. To ſuch as are deſtitute of this piece of Armour, to them I have onely one thing to ſay.</p>
                  <p>That which I would ſay to you that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this pretious Armour of faith, is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe two words.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Take heed that you do not ſuffer your ſelves to be diſputed out of your faith.</hi> The Devil uſeth all meanes to beguil wicked men into a fond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that they have faith, upon ſuch evidences that will not hold, for the prevention of that, I did in the former Uſe, both diſcover ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, and lay down ſome poſitive evidences. On the other ſide, Satan doth what he can to argue true Beleivers out of an opinion of their faith, labouring to perſwade them, that they have not this grace in their hearts. For the helping of the Servants of God againſt this ſtratagem, I ſhall propound ſome of thoſe arguings, and give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to them. They are theſe three.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Satan will argue a nullity of faith ſometimes from the abſence of aſſurance, and ſenſe of preſent comfort.</hi> This is an Objection which ordinarily Beleivers make againſt themſelves, to their very great prejudice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:170109:138"/>
For the anſwering of this Argument, I ſhall lay down theſe two propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>That there may be, and ordinarily is, true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith where there is no aſſurance.</hi> There may be the faith of adherence, where there never yet was the faith of evidence. The ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> had their money in their ſacks mouths a good ſpace before they knew of it; the treaſure of faith is in the ſoul often very long before the ſoul have aſſurance of it<hi>:</hi> Theſe three Arguments will prove this poſition.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>From the deſcriptions that are made of faith in the word of God.</hi> Its called, <hi>coming to Chriſt, Math.</hi> 11. 28. Its called, <hi>caſting our burden upon the Lord, Pſalm</hi> 37. 5. Its nothing but the ſouls venturing it ſelf upon Chriſt; faith is but the coming to Chriſt, as <hi>Eſther</hi> did to <hi>Ahaſuerus, If I periſh, I periſh.</hi> Its called, <hi>looking upon Chriſt, Mic.</hi> 7. 7. None of all theſe are words of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. A man may come to another, and not be aſſured that he will not turn from him. A man may roll his burthen upon the ſhoulder of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is not aſſured that he will carry it for him. A man may look for a perſon, whom he is not aſſured he ſhall find, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>From the inſtances given in Scripture of ſome that have had true faith, and wanted aſſurance.</hi> The father of that <hi>Daemoniack,</hi> of whom we read, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 22. he was not aſſured that Chriſt was able to caſt out the dumb ſpirit, much leſs was he aſſured that Chriſt was willing: <hi>If thou canſt do any thing, have compaſſion on us and help us:</hi> This was far from aſſurance, and ſo that which he ſaith ver. 24. <hi>Lord, I beleive, help thou my unbeleif:</hi> here
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170109:139"/>
was no perfect aſſurance, and yet true faith, as the <note place="margin">Eſay 50. 10 Pſalm 38. <hi>per totum.</hi> Heman <hi>a true beleiver</hi>
                     </note> iſſue of the ſtory ſayes; the Devil was caſt out of his child.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>There muſt be faith from the nature of the thing, before there can be aſſurance.</hi> Therefore there may be faith without aſſurance, <hi>Make your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. A man may not onely be elected, but called, and yet not ſure of his effectual calling: you muſt have a title to a poſſeſſion, before you can be certainly aſſured of ſuch an intereſt. Sealing with the holy Spirit of promiſe comes after beleiving ordinarily, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. A child as ſoon as he is born hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but he wants a reflected act to know that he hath reaſon; ſo it is in Regeneration.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Aſſurance may be loſt for a time in thoſe, who have formerly enjoyed it.</hi> He that hath walked in the light of Gods countenance, may come to walk in darkneſs again, <hi>Eſay</hi> 50. 10. There are three caſes in which this doth ordinarily fall out. 1. In the hour of temptation, when God lets Satan looſe to buffet the ſoul, aſſurance may be loſt in ſuch a time. 2. in the day of ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, when God hides his face from the ſoul<hi>:</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was in this condition, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Math:</hi> 27. 46. A man in a ſwound doth not know he lives. 3. In the ſtate of relapſes, when a beleiver hath fallen into ſome ſin, God withdraws the aſſurance of his graces and leaves him to gain his faith and other graces, takes away the joy of his faith, and leaves him nothing but deadneſs and horror in his conſcience. This was the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 12. <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation.</hi> Though he had
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170109:139"/>
not loſt the grace of faith, yet he had quite loſt the joy of his faith.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Satan endeavours ſometimes to argue Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians out of their faith, by comparing it with the faith of other of God Servants which hath been very ſtrong. Abraham,</hi> ſaith Satan, was ſtrong in faith, he did not <hi>deſceptare,</hi> but was mighty in faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. <hi>Job</hi> he had a powerful faith: <hi>Though he kill me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 13. 15. but thy faith is weak, &amp;c. To help you againſt this ſtratagem, I ſhall lay down theſe four conſiderations. <hi>Viz,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the ſtrongeſt of theſe great Champions have had their ſtaggerings and their faintings. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> though he was mighty in faith at that time when God promiſed him a ſon, yet at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time did both ſtagger and fall: Twice he denied his Wife for fear of men; once in <hi>Egypt, Gen.</hi> 12. 12. a ſecond time at <hi>Gerar, Gen.</hi> 20. 2. <hi>David</hi> though he had ſo much ſtrength of faith at one time, that he durſt encounter <hi>Goliah</hi> with his ſling, when the hearts of all the valiant men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> trembled, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 32. yet at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time his faith was ſo faint, that he ſaid, all men were liars, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 116. 11. and for want of faith fled out of the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27. 1. <hi>Moſes</hi> whoſe faith was ſo ſtrong, that he forſook the pleaſures of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, and choſe rather to ſuffer affliction, &amp;c <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25. and yet at another time, when he had had many experiences of the power of God, was not able to beleive that God could bring water out of the Rock, he ſmote the Rock twice, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 10, 11. God bids him ſpeak to the Rock, and he ſmites it twice out of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170109:140"/>
And though he was ſo ſtrong in faith, that at one time he could beleive that the red Sea ſhould be divided, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. yet at another time he was ſo weak in faith, that he thought God had over-ſpoken his power, when he promiſed to give the people fleſh for a moneth: <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 21. <hi>The people amongſt whom I am are ſix hundred thouſand footmen, and thou haſt ſaid, I will give them fleſh for a whole moneth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Though theſe had never ſtaggered, yet is the promiſe made not to degrees of faith, but to truth of faith.</hi> The Devil is not able to ſhew one word in all the Book of God, which requires ſuch a meaſure of faith for ſalvation! Yea, the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are made to the weakeſt acts of faith: <hi>Look unto me and be ſaved, all ye ends of the earth, Eſay</hi> 45. 22. Looking is but a weak act of faith, and yet ſalvation is promiſed to it. Weak faith unites a perſon to Jeſus Chriſt as well as ſtrong faith. A ſhaking hand can receive an almes as well as a ſtrong hand. He that ſhoots in a long Bow, draws all by the ſtrength of his arm, much ſtrength is required to draw the bow, but he that ſhoots in a Croſs-bow hath ſtrength enough if he can but let off the ſtring, a child may ſhoot as far as a Gyant, becauſe the ſtrength lies in the Bow, not in the Arm; ſo is it with faith. If the King ſhould paſs a grant, that every living man in his Kingdom ſhould enjoy ſuch and ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, do you think weak men would be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? They are men as well as the ſtrongeſt. God hath made ſuch a Charter, that one that hath true faith in him ſhall enjoy ſuch and ſuch priviledges, and the weak beleiver is a beliver as well as the ſtrongeſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:170109:140"/>
3. <hi>Weak faith hath defacto found very gracious acceptance with God.</hi> That in <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 22, 23, 24. And the promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 20. <hi>He will not break the bruiſed reed, nor qvench the ſmoaking flax.</hi> A reed when it is whole hath no great ſtrength in it, but when it is bruiſed it is then weak indeed, and yet that hath been and will be averted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Though every beleever have not ſo much faith as</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>and</hi> David, <hi>&amp;c. yet every beleever hath as much merit as they had.</hi> The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Chriſt, the ſame Righteouſneſs, the ſame Covenant of Grace, the ſame Promiſes.; None of all theſe were juſtified by their faith as an act or work, but by their faith as an inſtrument ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Chriſt the object of faith. Now though every beleever have not the ſame faith, yet he hath the ſame object of faith, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſame acceptance.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Satan ſometimes argues nullity of faith, from the non-acceptance of our prayers.</hi> If you had faith God would hear your prayers, but you have prayed a long time for ſuch a mercy, and can get no anſwer from God, therefore your faith is not true faith, but a groundleſs preſumption. For the anſwering of this objection, I ſhall lay down theſe three Conſiderations, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We are to diſtinguiſh between Gods act in anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering prayers, and mans act in receiving that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi> A Beleever may think his prayers not to be anſwered ſometimes, becauſe he doth not mind the anſwer of his prayers. <hi>I will hearken</hi> ſaith the <note place="margin">Pſal. 55. 8.</note> Pſalmiſt, <hi>what the Lord God will ſay, for he will ſpeak peace to his ſervants, &amp;c.</hi> Beleevers are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170109:141"/>
ſtupid and cannot hearken, ſometimes ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and will not hearken; they do not look after their prayers, they do not ſtand upon the watch tower, as the Prophet reſolves, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 1. Gods anſwer to our prayers are ſometimes given in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and ſecretly, that without very much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention we cannot tell what the anſwer imports. Very often the ſoul thinks his prayers are caſt out when he hath the anſwer of them in his boſom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God hath more wayes of anſwering Prayers than one.</hi> God may give a very full anſwer to our prayers, though he do not anſwer them in that particular way we deſire. God hath no where promiſed to anſwer the prayers of beleevers in Kind, though he have promiſed that he will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them according to their benefit. We have three remarkable inſtances of this. That in <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 7. Our Saviour refuſed to anſwer them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter of their deſire, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons, &amp;c.</hi> But yet he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers them according to their neceſſity, <hi>You ſhall receive power from on high, &amp;c.</hi> That in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9. God refuſed to anſwer <hi>Pauls</hi> prayer in <hi>Specie,</hi> the thorn in fleſh, whatſoever it was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a bodily diſeaſe as ſome think, or a ſpiritual diſtemper as others conceive, was not removed, and yet his prayer was anſwered, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> And that of our Saviour <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>He was heard in that he feared.</hi> The particular thing he deſired was not granted. <hi>If it be poſſible let this cup paſs from me.</hi> The cup did not paſs away, but Chriſt had aſſiſtance and enablement to bear it without ſinking, and therein his prayer was
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170109:141"/>
heard. We ask ſometimes that which is not good for us, at leaſt not ſo good as ſome other thing. Now if God give us a better thing for a thing which is leſs good, doth he not hear? If God deny <hi>Moſes</hi> to go into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and take him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, what loſs doth he ſuſtein? <hi>Deus non audit ad voluntatem ut audiat ad neceſſitatem.</hi> There's denial in mercy, as well as hearing in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and there is hearing in judgement, as well as denial in judgement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 30.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>God many times delayes, when he doth not deny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. We many times ask the preſent enjoyment of things not ſo good at that ſeaſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 10. 11. <hi>How long Lord, &amp;c.</hi> They muſt yet tarry till the mercy was ſeaſonable. <hi>Their feet ſhall ſlide in due time, Deut.</hi> 32. 35. 2. We are not ſo importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in our ſuits as we ſhould be, our prayers though for things ſeaſonably good, may be too faint; God in ſuch caſes delayes to quicken our zeal. <hi>Anſelme</hi> in his meditations ſpeaks excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to this purpoſe: <hi>Gloria mea, Deus meus, abſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condis the ſaurum tuum ut niciles cupidum, recondis margaritam, ut augeas quaerentis amorem, differs</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 194.</note> 
                     <hi>dare ut doleas petere, diſſimulas audire pellutem ut facias preſerverantem</hi> 3. God is well pleaſed with our muſick, therefore he lets us lay begging. This is the firſt branch of the Exhortarion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Labour earneſtly to repair, confirm and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then this ſhield of faith.</hi> Though weak faith if it be true, will carry you to heaven, yet will not weak faith carry you through ſtrong Aſſaults. If this ſhield be crackt and broken, you may be ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foil'd in the day of temptation. I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a few Helps for the ſtrengthening of faith.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:170109:142"/>
1. <hi>Be frequent in acting your faith.</hi> Habits are weakned by being idle, but they are ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by dayly exerciſe. <hi>Scribendo diſces ſcribere.</hi> and <hi>Credendo diſces credere.</hi> The more frequent a Chriſtian is in putting forth acts of faith, the ſtronger will the Habit of faith be. There is this difference between the ſhield of faith and other ſhields, thoſe by too much uſe are made weak; but this ſhield is the ſtronger by every battel, it cannot be uſed too often. <hi>Vide Rom.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Be much in fervent prayer to God that he would ſtrengthen your faith.</hi> The Apoſtle made uſe of this help, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 5. Faith and Prayer are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters one of another, our faith teacheth us both what to ask, and how to ask; and our praying helps beleeving. If prayer be reſtrained, faith will be weakned, but if prayer be continued faith will be confirmed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Be frequent in the right uſe of the Word and Sacrament.</hi> The Word is the ordinary means for the breeding of faith, and the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament are the food whereby faith is nouriſhed and increaſed. The Sacraments are the ſeals of the righteouſneſs of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. He that is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the application of theſe ſeals, is like to be moſt confirmed in beleeving. Chriſtians do very much prejudice their faith by neglecting of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God for the nouriſhment of faith.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 <hi>Study carefully the promiſes of the Covenant of grace.</hi> Gods promiſes are made of purpoſe to confirm faith in us. The promiſes are the fewel of faith.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Study the Attributes of Gods Nature.</hi> His
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170109:142"/>
Power, Wiſedome, Faithfulneſs, Truth, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. This was that which ſtrengthned the faith of <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 11. 27. Theſe are ſtrong props which will keep faith from ſinking when its rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to dye. This is the firſt branch of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation which concerns Beleevers.</p>
                  <p>2. That which I would ſay to unbeleevers is this, <hi>That they would labour for this grace of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying and ſaving faith.</hi> There are many things which may be as motives to preſs you to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>All the promiſes of grace are to you of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> They all run upon the condition of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. The Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that beleeve.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>All the blood and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt is of none effect to an unbeleever.</hi> Tis faith that gives the ſoul an intereſt in Chriſts blood.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>All their holy duties and religious actions without faith are diſpleaſing unto God. Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices without faith is no better than the cutting off a dogs neck, Incence without faith is no better than the bleſſing of an Idol, killing of an Oxe, is no better than the killing of a Man, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of Oblation, is no better than the offering of Swines blood, &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 3. But I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urge it upon this ground, you can never do any good againſt Satan in the day of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if you want this ſhield. As it happened to the accuſers of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when they were caſt into the Lions den, ſo it wil happen to you in the day of temptation if you want this ſhield. Its
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170109:143"/>
ſaid the Lions had the maſtery over them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came to the bottom of the den, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 24. So it will be with you, the roaring Lion will have the maſtery over you and break you into pieces, if you want this ſhield.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, what courſe ſhould we take to get this grace.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Study the miſchief of an unbeleeving heart.</hi> The Apoſtle calls it an evil heart of unbeleef, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Its ſinfully evil.</hi> Hard, dark, dead, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, filthy, deceitful and falſe, deceiving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and it ſelf alſo.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Its penally evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It makes all the Ordinances ineffectual. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It binds all a mans ſins upon his own back. It ſeals up all our ſins, becauſe it keeps us from that which is the onely remedy againſt ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It defiles every thing to a man. To the clean all things are clean, but to the unbeleevers and them that are defiled is nothing clean, but even their Conſciences are defiled, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It brings certain condemnation. As ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is the end of our faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. So is damnation the end of unbeleef, <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that beleeveth not the Son ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Study the Inſufficiency of Self,</hi> Look upon the rottenneſs and nothingneſs of all Moral Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170109:143"/>
righteouſneſs. Too high thoughts of Civill righteouſneſs, is that which hinders thouſands from beleeving. Remember that of the Apoſtle <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Though I might alſo have confidence in the fleſh, if any other man think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he hath whereof he might truſt in the fleſh: I more. Circumciſed the eighth day of the ſtock of Iſrael, of the Tribe of Benjamine, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, &amp;c. Concerning the righteouſneſs which is in the Law blameleſs, &amp;c. But what were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs, &amp;c. Yea doubtleſs I account all things but loſs, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Study thorowly the All-ſufficient fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the object of faith.</hi> He is not a broken reed, he is not an houſe of ſand, but a rock; a corner ſtone, upon whom whoſoever beleeveth ſhall never be aſhamed. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Jeſus Chriſt is that which hinders many from beleeving in him. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>init.</hi> Who hath beleeved our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? for he ſhall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground, he hath no form nor comelineſs, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him. He is deſpiſed and rejected of men, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Study him well therefore, in Point of Merit; in point of grace. Study him in all his Offices of King, Prieſt, Prophet, and then you will ſay as the Daughters of Jeruſalem did, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Whether is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:170109:144"/>
4. <hi>Study the deep guilt of Adam, in the polution of thy own Nature.</hi> Thoſe that are whole need not the Phyſitian, but they that are ſick. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of our guilt and miſery, is a neceſſary preparative to ſaving faith. Now the Scripture doth clearly affirme, that all men have ſinned and are come ſhort of the glory of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. And then take in this conſideration that neither your ſelves, nor any other Creature, is able to free you from that guilt, that there is no other way of ſalvation but onely by hanging upon Jeſus Chriſt alone, He it is which God hath ſanctified and ſet apart for the ſatisfying of his own Juſtice, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the World to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Conſider the willingneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to eaſe, and ſave, and take of burthens.</hi> Though the diſeaſe be never ſo deſperate, and the Phyſitian never ſo able, yet if his willingneſs be not known little encouragement will be to any to go to him, but Jeſus Chriſt is as willing as able.</p>
                  <p>1. He was ſanctified for that work. <hi>Vide I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</hi> 61. 1. 2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, for he hath annointed me to preach good tydings to the meek, &amp;c.</hi> The Son of Man came to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt.</p>
                  <p>2. Read and peruſe all the ſolemn invitations which are given unto men to beleeve in him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me, &amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. 2. And Chriſt is not in jeſt, but very reall in making theſe tenders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:170109:144"/>
3. Read and peruſe ſeriouſly all the Aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are uſed to aſſure men that if they will come, they ſhall not be refuſed. <hi>Vide John</hi> 6. 37. <hi>Verily verily I ſay unto you, he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Never any was caſt out, never any will be caſt out, that comes to him after a right manner.</p>
                  <p>4. Read and conſider all the Lamentations and ſad Complaints made by Jeſus Chriſt, of the backwardneſs and unwillingneſs of men to lay hold upon him. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye may have life. John</hi> 5. 40. And that in <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 34. of Jeruſalem. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, &amp;c. How often would I have gathered thy Children together, as an Hen doth her brood, &amp;c. and ye would not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Wait conſtantly upon the publick Miniſtry which God hath appointed to be the ordinary means of working faith in the heart.</hi> He that neglects this means, and doth not conſcionably attend upon it, will dye either preſuming or diſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>And you will be encouraged to this, if you conſider how many thouſands have been brought out of themſelves unto faith in Chriſt, by the power of Gods Spirit working in and by this meanes. Hereby <hi>Lydia</hi> was brought out of unbeleef. Hereby the Jewes who crucified Chriſt were brought to beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt for the ſaving of their ſouls, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. <hi>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The hope of ſalvation, is called <hi>Salvation</hi> by a metonymy, becauſe it doth expect ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and becauſe where it is true, it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and bring forth ſalvation.

               <list>
                  <item>1. I ſhall open the nature of this grace of Hope, ſhew how it agrees with, and how it differs from the former grace of Faith.</item>
                  <item>2. I ſhall ſhew you wherein the grace of Hope is like a Helmet.</item>
                  <item>3 Wherein its uſeful to reſiſt and overcome Temptations.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. <hi>Hope is a ſaving grace of Gods holy ſpirit wrought in a regenerate perſon, whereby he doth firmly and patiently expect the certain accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all future good which God hath promiſed, and faith beleeves.</hi> In the opening of this Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170109:146"/>
we ſhall ſee both wherein it agreeth, and wherein it differs from faith.</p>
               <p>There is ſuch an Affinity between faith an hope that they can hardly be differenced, they cannot be ſeparated one from another; they have reſpect one to another, as the two Cherubins on the mercy ſeat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 20. And yet they are really diſtinguiſhed in the Scripture, they are ſeveral things, <hi>Now abideth Faith, Hope, and Charity,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. The Scripture makes them three ſeveral things. The agreement and difference of them will be manifeſted by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding of the former Deſcription.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Hope is a ſaving grace of Gods Spirit.</hi> I ſay a ſaving grace to difference it from that natural Hope which is not ſaving; we read of a hope that is as a ſpiders web, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 14. Of a hope that ſhall be cut off, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 14. Of a hope that ſhall be as the giving up of the ghoſt, <hi>Job</hi> 11. 20. And then I ſay of Gods Spirit, to ſhew the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree and the original of it. The Scripture makes it to be a fruit and work of Gods Spirit. Now herein faith and hope agree, they are both in regard of their nature ſaving graces, and they are both from the ſpirit of God, as the fountain and efficient cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Wrought in a regenerate perſon.</hi> This is the ſubject of it. Neither the profane perſon, nor the hypocrite hath this glorious flower of hope growing in them, that natural hope is found both in wicked perſons and hypocrites, but this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hope hath abiding only in the hearts of ſuch as are truly converted. Now here alſo it agrees with faith. As both of them proceed from the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170109:147"/>
ſame root, ſo both of them have the ſame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubject, they differ in the particular ſubject, <note place="margin">Luther ut ſupra.</note> faith is in the underſtanding, hope in the Will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Whereby he doth expect.</hi> This word notes the nature of this grace. Expectation or wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the proper work of hope. Thus the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth expreſs it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 5. <hi>My ſoul wait thou onely upon God, for my expectation is from him. Pſal.</hi> 130. 5. <hi>I wait for the Lord, my ſoul doth wait, and in his word do I hope. Pſal.</hi> 123. 2. <hi>As the eyes of ſervants, &amp;c. ſo our eyes waite upon the Lord, untill that he have mercy upon us.</hi> Nor is it a ſlight careleſs expectation, but a very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment intention, both of body in expecting and waiting, when a man doth ſtretch out his ſpirit and mind to look for a thing, ſo the word <hi>(Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah)</hi> ſignifies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>I will wait upon the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Magná in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentione &amp; corporis ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctare,</note> 
                  <hi>Lord that hideth his face, &amp;c. and I will look for him.</hi> The Apoſtle ſets it out by a greek word of the ſame ſignification, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19. <hi>The earneſt expectation of the Creature, &amp;c.</hi> It ſignifies to look with a ſtretched out neck, as a condemned priſoner for a hope for pardon. Now herein it differs from faith, faith is not in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in making things evident; hope is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation and waiting for things evidenced by faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It expects firmly and patiently.</hi> Theſe two properties of hope we have in Scripture. 1. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects firmly or certainly. The Apoſtle mentions the full Aſſurance of hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 11. Hope is never without aſſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ance, ſaith Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> though not of the thing, yet of perſwaſion, for the firmneſs and ſtedfaſtneſs of it is compared to an
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170109:147"/>
Anchor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. <hi>Which hope we have as an Anchor of the ſoul both ſure and ſtedfaſt.</hi> 2. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects with patience, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>The Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect your hearts into the love of God, and the patient waiting for Chriſt.</hi> Faith is our Logick, ſaith <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to conceive what we muſt beleeve; Hope is our Rhetorick to perſwade us in tribulation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to patience. <hi>Reſt in the Lord, and wait patiently for him Pſal.</hi> 37. 7. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 1. <hi>I waited pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The accompliſhment of future good.</hi> This ſhews the object of Hope, generally that which is good; particularly or ſpecially future good. Herein it differs from faith. The object of faith is not onely good things, but evill things alſo. Faith beleeves the threatnings as well as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; Faith doth beleeve there is an Hell as well as an Heaven; but Hope onely looks at good things. Evill things are the proper object of fear and hatred, not of hope. And then this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in the ſpiritual object. Hope onely looks at good things to come, what a man ſees, why <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 24.</note> doth he yet hope for it? hope that is ſeen is not hope. Thats the difference between hope and viſion. But now faith looks not onely at things that are to come, but alſo at things that are paſt, and at things that are preſent. It looks to things paſt. We beleeve that the World was created, that <hi>Adam</hi> fell, that the old world was drowned, that Chriſt was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that he ſuffered, that he dyed, &amp;c. We beleeve alſo things that are preſent. We beleeve that Chriſt is at the right hand of God, that he makes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent interceſſion. And we alſo beleeve things
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170109:148"/>
that are to come. We beleeve that Antichriſt ſhall fall, that Chriſt ſhall come to judge the World, that our dead bodies ſhall be raiſed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Which God hath promiſed.</hi> Herein faith and hope agree, they have both the ſame Baſis or foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> The word of promiſe. The Scripture aſſerts the promiſe to be the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hope, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 2. There could be no reaſon of expectation unleſs the thing expected were bottomed upon a divine promiſe. Its looſe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not well grounded waiting, which is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected upon a promiſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>And Faith beleeveth.</hi> This holds out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difference between Faith and Hope. They differ in their order. Faith goes before, Hope followes, the ſtedfaſtneſs of hope is from the certainty of faith, faith beleeves the truth of the thing, and hope waits for the accompliſhment of it. The Apoſtle tells us that <hi>faith is the ſubſtance or ground of things hoped for, Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Faith is the Mother of hope, and hope is the Daughter of faith; faith diſcovers the treaſure, and hope gathers it and layes it up. Faith is the fire of hope, and hope is the flame of faith.</p>
               <p>2. Wherein the Reſemblance between Hope and a Helmet. Conſider that in four things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Helmet doth defend the head from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered either by ſword, piſtoll, &amp;c.</hi> The grace of Hope doth ſafeguard the ſoul from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Satan.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Helmet is the higheſt of al the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres Armour. The grace of Hope is that which looks ſtill upwards; tis the higheſt of the graces, it hath its eye fixed upon the things which are in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170109:148"/>
(3.) <hi>The Helmet doth make the Souldier, of dreadful appearance to his adverſary. Polybius</hi> tels us, that the Romane Souldiers had upon their Helmets, garlands ſticking upon ſpikes ſo high, that they ſeemed of a double height, and did appear very formidable to the enemy: Men of low ſtature ſeemed exceeding high, by reaſon of their Helmets, and that dreſs which they wore upon them. The Grace of Hope upon the head, makes the Chriſtian Souldier very formidable to Satan, it doth lift him up even to Heaven. Little <hi>David,</hi> with his Helmet of Hope, appeared of a greater height then <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah,</hi> though he had a Helmet of Braſs. Hope ſets the Soul upon a Rock, which is higher then all his Adverſaries.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) The Helmet doth give warmth and heat to the head: it hath a refreſhing, as well as a defending virtue in it. The Grace of Hope, warms and refreſhes the Heart.</p>
               <p>III. Wherein this Grace is uſefull to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in the time of Temptation.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>The Grace of Hope helps Chriſtian Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</hi> It ſharpens the edge of Chriſtian Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: faintneſs and fearfulneſs of Spirit, gives a very great advantage to the enemy. That was a good Martial Law which <hi>God</hi> gave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 8. If the heart once ſink through cowardice, and puſillanimity, the hands grow weak. Now the grace of Hope keeps the heart from ſinking; yea, it adds courage to the heart: We have a Proverb, <hi>But for Hope, the heart</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:170109:149"/>
                  <hi>would break.</hi> I had fainted, unleſs I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the Living, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 13. Upon this, he gives an Exhortation to others, to hope in <hi>God,</hi> with a promiſe of ſtrength, <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Wait on the Lord, be of good courage,</hi> &amp;c. The exerciſe of this grace, kept the Apoſtles from ſinking, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 16, 18. <hi>For this cauſe we faint not,</hi> &amp;c. While we look not at the things which are ſeen; but at the things which are not ſeen, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>The Grace of Hope doth ſtrengthen Faith.</hi> Though Faith breed Hope, yet doth Hope ſtrengthen Faith: It is as a ſtaff to her aged mother, as one well obſerves. Faith is the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of things not ſeen: Faith makes things that are not ſeen evident, and then the grace of Hope helps the Evidence of Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>The Grace of Hope helps the Soul to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere.</hi> Victory is promiſed onely to ſuch as hold out unto the end. <hi>Be thou faithful unto the death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 10. Now without Hope, there can be no perſeverance. He that hath loſt his hope, will either yield, or run, or make ſome unworthy compoſition: but now Hope will carry on the Soul in its oppoſition.</p>
               <p>There are two things which Hope doth to help us to perſevere.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It faſtens the Eye upon the ſight of the Crown; it layes that at the foot of the Soul, and encourageth it to continue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It fetches in help from heaven; it faſtens the Eye upon Jeſus Chriſt, and lets it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170109:149"/>
ſee that He is fighting for them, while they are fighting for themſelves: It ſhewes the Soul Recruits marching from Heaven, for its Relief and aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Information. (1.) <hi>This lets us ſee the benefit and excellency of the Grace of Hope.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeakes very much in the commendation of it. It's the ſecond of thoſe three choice Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Faith, Hope, Charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 13. It's that which brings heaven down to the Soul, or raiſes the Soul to heaven, even when the Soul is here on earth. It's the Soul's Comforter in all the troubles, afflictions, and evils, which it ſuſtains in this life. It's that by which we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome Satan in the day of Temptations. It's the Soul's Anchor, by which it rides ſafely in the tempeſtuous Sea of Temptations. Of all the Graces, it is that which promiſes leaſt, but there is no Grace that is of more uſe then this. It's well compared by one to an Egge that hath more in it then is ſeen. An Egge hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be ſeen, but a dry barren ſhell, unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for nouriſhment; but if you break the ſhell, you ſhall find it full of moſt delicate nouriſhment. The Grace of Hope, to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, is like to a dry ſhall; but if you open this ſhell, you will find it full of moſt delicate nouriſhment. We are upheld by Hope, when we ſtand: We riſe by Hope, when we are caſt down. We live by Hope: We are ſaved by Hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:170109:150"/>
It's that which encourageth us to all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: We pray in hope, we hear in hope. Take away Hope, and the Soul will not be able to do any duty. It's that by which we bear all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments. It's a Sun in the darkeſt mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. Take away Hope, and the Soul will be ſwallowed up with the leaſt croſs, every wind will blow it down, every wave will drown it, every difficulty will overwhelm it. It's the Grace of Hope which holds the Chin above water in every trouble: its the grace of Hope, by which we live in the want of preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Take away this Grace of Hope, and all the Promiſes are but as withered graſs, and dry bones, and empty veſſels, which cannot give ſatisfaction. All diſquietments, and vexatious cares, ariſe either from the want, or the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Grace of Hope. <hi>David</hi> chargeth all his diſquietneſs upon this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142. 11. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, why art thou vexed within me? Hope in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him</hi> &amp;c. Hope ſettles the heart in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: it turns darkneſs into light, and ſtorms into calmes, and makes the ſhadow of death as the morning. <hi>Tbou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in thee,</hi> Eſa 26. 3.</p>
               <p>I am the larger in this, becauſe there is ſuch a generall neglecting of the exerciſe of this Grace: The Grace of Hope is almoſt loſt; Chriſtians make but little uſe, and very little
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170109:150"/>
account of it. Faith is in ſome repute, but Hope is buried; whereas, indeed, Faith is not more excellent then Hope. Hope begins, where Faith ends.</p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>This lets us ſee why Satan uſes ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to drive the ſervants of God into a ſtate of deſperation.</hi> There are two great Rockes on which Satan labours to ſplit the ſouls of men: the one, is upon the Rock of Preſumption; many ſouls periſh this way: The other is, the Rock of Deſpair; and there are many more then a few deſtroyed this way. <hi>Judas,</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> fell by this Temptation. My puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is greater then I can bear, ſaith <hi>Cain.</hi> And <hi>Judas,</hi> out of horrour of Conſcience, puts an end to his own life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 5. Satan is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſie in our age this way, ſuggeſting unto the hearts of men, that ſalvation doth not belong to them. We ſee there is reaſon why Satan ſhould uſe his skill this way: This is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Head-piece; and if he can but perſwade him to caſt off this, he will very eaſily make a prey of him. Deſpair of mercy, is a greater ſin, then all other ſins; <hi>Judas</hi> deſpair was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his Treaſon.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It's derogatory to the Mercy of <hi>GOD,</hi> for it calls in queſtion his truth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It's derogatory to the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt; it calls in queſtion the All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of his bloud, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:170109:151"/>
(3.) <hi>That the aſſurance of Salvation is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine very profitable for Chriſtians, and very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to Satan.</hi> If the hope of Salvation help a Chriſtian in temptarion, ſurely the aſſurance of it will much more help him in theſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts look upon it as a great and groundleſſe preſumption, for any man to talk of aſſurance of his ſalvation: But we know from Scripture,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That many have attained to aſſurance: we know, that if our Earthly Tabernacle were diſſolved, we have a building of <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>init.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That all the people of God are commanded to labour after the attainment of it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That ſo many Evidences of a man that ſhall be ſaved, are not laid down in vain. The Scripture is full of the Characters of a perſon that ſhall be ſaved. We know we are tranſlated from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. Know ye not, that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That one great Office of the Spirit of God which dwelleth in the hearts of the regenerate, is to ſeal them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. To te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie with their Spirits that they are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. The Holy Ghoſt is a witneſſing and ſealing Spirit, as well as a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170109:151"/>
Spirit; a Spirit of Revelation, as well as a Spirit of Grace. Now the Argument is firm: If the hope of Salvation be a Helmet to protect us; then is the full Aſſurance of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation a helmet much more ſtrong.</p>

               <p>Exhortation. (1.) To all in generall. <hi>Let this put all the Sons of men upon the getting of well-grounded hopes of ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOr the urging of this Exhortation, theſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2.</note> two things are to be opened, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. To remove ſome falſe grounds of hope. 2. To hold out ſome poſitive grounds, upon which Salvation may be infallibly and certainly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, and expected.</p>
               <p>(1.) There are three falſe grounds, upon which many are deceived, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Outward proſperity is no certain ground of ſalvation.</hi> Many men do certainly conclude their Eſtate is good, and that they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that <hi>God</hi> doth undoubtedly love them with a ſaving love, becauſe their porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is fat in this world; they have the bleſſing of God upon whatever they put their hands to, God proſpers them greatly in the world,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170109:152"/>
&amp;c. therefore they hope they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>For the removing of this, (1.) Something is to be granted. (2.) Something to be denyed. (1.) It is to be granted, That true piety and holineſs, is the high and ready way to outward proſperity, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. Godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, and of the life that is to come. Many promiſes are made in the Scripture, of theſe outward things to the godly, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 16. 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 1, 2, 3. onely this promiſe is to be underſtood, with this caution of <hi>Reference and ſubordination to their ſpirituall good.</hi> This Caution is alwayes in Scripture to be underſtood, when proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is promiſed to the godly, and it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſſed, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 10. (2.) It is to be denied, that outward proſperity is any evidence of ſalvation. And that I ſhall prove by theſe three Arguments. 1. <hi>The worſt of men have, and may enjoy much of theſe things, who ſhall never ſee ſalvation. Mat.</hi> 16. 26, our Savior ſuppoſes there more then ever any man ſhall enjoy, he that hath the whole world, muſt have theſe four things. 1. All the Riches, Honours, Pleaſures of the world. 2. A heart capable to take delight in all theſe. 3. A time of enjoying theſe from the firſt man to the laſt. 4. Freedom from all vexations and troubles of ſpirit. All theſe things are neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to the making good of this ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170109:153"/>
And yet if any man could attain to this, yet he might for ever be a caſt-away, and loſe his ſoul. There are many rich men now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the vengeance of eternall fire, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 18. &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 19, 20, 23. <hi>The beſt of men have, and may want outward proſperity, Heb.</hi> 11. 37. Some are there mentioned, of whom the world was not worthy, and yet were deſtitute, afflicted, tormented. Moſt or all the Prophets and Apoſtles, yea Chriſt himſelf muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of Heaven, if this were an evidence of ſalvation. 3. <hi>There would be no ſin in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, if this were any ground of ſalvation.</hi> The Scripture reckons covetouſneſs amongſt the groſſeſt and worſt of ſins, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. Its no ſin for a man to get an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of ſalvation with all his diligence. The love of money would not be the root of all evill, as the Apoſtle brands it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. but the root of all good, if this were an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Outward Profeſſion is no certain ground of ſalvation.</hi> Many men build their hopes of ſalvation, onely on profeſſion. They hear, they pray, &amp;c. That this is no infallible evidence of ſalvation, will appear by theſe two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>(1.) Becauſe many who have been forward in profeſſion, have been rejected in regard of eternal ſalvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 26, 27. <hi>Iſay</hi> 58. 2, 3. A naturall principle may carry a man to all
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170109:153"/>
the duties of outward profeſſion.</p>
               <p>(2.) Becauſe then there would be no ſuch thing in the Church as hypocriſie, whereas the Scripture makes a difference between the form of godlineſs, and the power of godlineſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Civill morall Righteouſneſs is no infallible evidence of ſalvation.</hi> Many perſons build their ſalvation upon this, that they are civilly juſt, they are free from ſcandalous ſins. They are no Theeves, Adulterers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſhed, that all men were free from theſe groſſe offences: he that walks in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe, can certainly have no hope of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the grace of God that bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, hath appeared unto men, &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. But yet there are many preſidents in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which prove that all this may be in ſuch, as are out of the ſtate of ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11. God I thank thee I am not as other men, &amp;c. He was no ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, no Drunkard, &amp;c. and yet in the Gall of bitterneſs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 1. 2. They were Virgins, not Harlots: they kept company with the wiſe Virgins, and were not only in their own apprehenſion, but in the charitable judgement of others, in a good condition; and yet when the Bridegroom came, they would not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they wanted Oil in their Lamps, and ſo were excluded the Mariage-Chamber, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170109:154"/>
that with this ſad word, I know you not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 12. He was no ſcandalous ſinner. As far as men could look, he was very right, none but the eye of the King, who ſees what is in man, could diſcern any defect in him, and yet caſt out with ſhame into outer darkneſs, verſe 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That young man in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 18, 19, 20. He was not only free from ſcandall, but he was very exact in many outward things. All theſe have I kept from my youth. There were ſo many common graces in him, as were worth the drawing out of affection. Jeſus loved him, ſaith another Evangeliſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 21. and yet out of the ſtate of ſalvation for the preſent: he went away ſorrowful, for he was very rich.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. 20. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch as were not ſcandalous, they had eſcaped the pollution of the world, and yet far from ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſeparation which ſhall be made at the laſt day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 32. is a proof of this. It is not of ſheep and Wolves, but of ſheep and Goats. Sheep and Goats feed together, and herd together, and yet Goats ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as well as Wolves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 20. How exact the Scribes and Phariſees were, for all acts of externall righteouſneſs, will appear from that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170109:154"/>
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 5. 6. concerning the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law blameleſs, and yet at that time, out of the ſtate of ſalvation. Sin may be reſtrained, when it is not mortified. A perſon may be under the raign and Dominion of ſin, who is not under the rage and fury of ſin. Sin may be reſtrained in men unconverted,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By civill education. Thus it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> before his converſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By outward affliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 34. when he ſlew them, they ſought him, 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17. 25, 26. God ſent Lions amongſt them. Thoſe devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Creatures reſtrained their ſin for a time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By the external power of Ordinances. Humane Ordinances may reſtrain ſin, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4. When the Angel of God came to <hi>Balaam</hi> with his dtawn Sword, he put him to a preſent ſtop: the Sword of Magiſtracy may do this.</p>
               <p>Divine Ordinances. The thundring of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and damnation from the publique Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, may reſtrain ſin for a time. Go down ſaith God, to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſet bounds, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 12. <hi>vid.</hi> Cap. 20. 18. When the people heard the thundrings, &amp;c. they removed, and ſtood a far off.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By common grace, ſuch was <hi>Abimelech's</hi> reſtraint, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For poſitive evidences, I ſhall name but theſe three, <hi>viz.</hi>

1. That in <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Christ in them the Hope of Glory.</hi> The Rule of evidence is this, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is in that perſon, who hath a well-grounded hope of everlaſting glory.</hi> No man hath any foundation of hoping for eternal ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely he that hath Jeſus Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him. I might bring many concurrent teſtimonies of Scripture, for the proving of this, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle calles Chriſt <hi>our hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1. It is by Chriſt alone that we have hope. As he alone is <hi>our peace,</hi> ſo is he alone <hi>our hope.</hi> Now we may know, that Chriſt is in us, by theſe two evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>If Chriſt be in you the body is dead in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſin, Rom.</hi> 8. 10. he, that is withour Chriſt is dead in ſin, and he in whom Chriſt is, is <hi>dead to ſin.</hi> The Dominion of ſin is deſtroyed. The love of ſin is removed. Sin doth not raign, ſin is not affected, where Jeſus Chriſt dwells in power. Sin may be where Chriſt is, but it doth not bear ſway; it hath not a quiet Being, it is oppoſed, it is lamented, and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſin which breaks out in the life, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that root of bitterneſs which abides in the heart: Sin undiſcerned of the eye of man, as well as that which is diſcovered to the eye of man. Sin Dormant, as well as ſin Rampant, ſins of daily incurſion and infirmity, as well as ſcandalous ſins. Omiſſions of good, as well as the perpetration of evill.</p>

                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:170109:155"/>
2. <hi>If Chriſt be in them, the Image of Christ is in them.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. All things are become new. The minde and underſtanding are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed<hi>:</hi> he ſees what he did not before diſcern, The loathſomneſs of ſin, the beauty of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the preciouſneſs of Chriſt, the excellency of the ſoul, the emptineſs of all worldly things.</p>
               <p>The will is renewed, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 6. Before Chriſt came it was hard, ſtubborn, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſelfiſh; but now its made plyable, ductile, ſubmiſſive to God in all things, and that with chearfulneſs and conſtancy, and ſpeedineſſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 6. <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> before it was an Iron ſinew, a Brazen Wall, now 'tis fleſhly and yielding.</p>
               <p>The Conſcience is renewed. Before it was ſleepy, ſecure, ſtupid: now 'tis watchful, tender, ſenſible both of the leaſt ſin, and of the leaſt duty.</p>
               <p>The affections are renewed: love, joy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, fear, ſorrow, anger, zeal, were before miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed: now they are ſet on right objects, and greatly intended towards their objects. He loves God with a great love, he hates ſin with a perfect hatred. He rejoyceth in the hope of the glory of God, more then ever he did in the things of this life. He fears his God more then ever he ſlighted him. He is more grieved for ſin, then ever he was for any worldly loſſe: He is more angry with the wicked, then ever
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170109:156"/>
he was with the godly. His zeal is more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent for God, then ever it was for the world before converſion.</p>
               <p>2. That in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Every one that hath this hope, purifieth himſelf as God is pure.</hi> It is laid down not only by way of duty, but by way of evidence and character. He is continually cleanſing and purging himſelf from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the fear of God. No pattern will ſerve him, but God himſelfe the exemplar of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. He findes it written, <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16. and no other Copy is in his account fair enough for him to write after. If you read but verſe 13, 14. you ſhall finde the Apoſtle brings it in, as the Character and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of one that hath a right hope of Heaven. Gird up the loyns of your minde, &amp;c. And the like you have <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. You that think you have holineſs enough, you that can allow of any ſpots of ſin, do not talk of hoping for Heaven. This is not the fruit of ſuch hope. No man is more frequent in waſhing himſelf, then he that hath hopes of ſalvation. There is this reaſon for it, he ſees Heaven to be an holy place, and he deſires to be made like it before he come to enjoy it.</p>
               <p>3. That in <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. Our Converſation is in Heaven, from whence we look for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. <hi>He that hath a well-grounded hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation after this life, hath his thoughts and heart</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:170109:156"/>
                  <hi>much in Heaven while he is in this life.</hi> This hath been the guiſe of men that hoped for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. Cap. 5. <hi>init.</hi> His heart is not taken up much with any earthly thing. He is not too much lifted up with the enjoyment, nor too much caſt down with fear of loſing theſe mean things. His ſpirit is looſened from them, his heart is above them, his ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeth daily with things of an higher nature. He is with God when he goes to ſleep, and when he awakes, he is with him. He hath the Kingdom of God within him. Put this home, and ſee how it is with you. <hi>Whereſoever your Treaſure is, there (undoubtedly) will your hearts be alſo, Luke</hi> 12. 34.</p>
               <p>2.

               <p>The Directions are theſe 6. <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>[1] <hi>Labour to be armed againſt all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Satan, to drive you to deſpair.</hi> He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for this purpoſe three things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>Your own unworthineſſe.</hi> You are great ſinners, &amp;c. Againſt this do you conſider by way of anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:170109:157"/>
(1.) That as great ſinners as you are, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were, are now in Heaven, <hi>Manaſſeh, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That you do not expect Heaven for your own worthineſs, but for the worthineſs of Chriſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 32. I do not this for your ſakes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) That a Chriſtians worthineſs doth not conſiſt in legall perfection, but in ſincerity and remiſſion of ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) That you will not add to your unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, the great ſin of rejecting Jeſus Chriſt and deſpair.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) That its better to periſh hoping, then periſh deſpairing.</p>
               <p>(II.) <hi>The preſent overcaſtings of the light of Gods countenance, and your many outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> Againſt this, conſider (1.) 'Tis no new thing to the dear ſervants of God, to be under Spiritual Deſertions, and outward troubles. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 43. Generally, all that are now in heaven, have bin under theſe Clouds. (2) Theſe Providences are ſooneſt removed by the grace of Hope. God hath appointed them to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then this Grace, not to deſtroy it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43. <hi>ult. Lam.</hi> 3. 18, 19, 20, 21. (3.) God can make the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> a door of Hope, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
               <p>[III.] <hi>Many have been ſhipwracked upon falſe hopes: Ergo.</hi> Againſt this, anſwer, 1. That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have periſhed for want of Hope; many have been deſtroyed by deſpair, <hi>Cain, Judas, Saul:</hi>

2. Thoſe who have periſhed, did not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh becauſe they hoped, but becauſe they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped amiſs. 3. A commanded Duty is not to be neglected becauſe many by doing it amiſs have been rejected. Nouriſh the Grace of Faith; if Faith be ſtrong which is the Mother, Hope the Daughter will be ſtrong.

Sometimes its uſed Perſonally, for the third perſon of the Trinity, the Holy Ghoſt: and ſo I ſuppoſe it's uſed in this place. The Reaſons of it I ſhall ſhew afterwards. <hi>Which is the Word of God]</hi> There's a two-fold Word of God.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Subſtantial, or Eſſential Word of God,</hi> viz. Jeſus Chriſt, the ſecond Perſon of the Trinity, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. He is called the Word of GOD, for two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe as the Word is <hi>Character men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> in men; ſo Chriſt the Son is the Character, or expreſs <hi>Effigies</hi> of the Fathers Counſel: The word, or ſpeech, is <hi>Interpres mentis:</hi> ſo Chriſt is <hi>Interpres Patris, Joh.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is called the Word of God, in regard of his perſonal properties of working: whereas the Father workes by way of hidden counſel; the Holy Ghoſt, by way of internall virtue; the Son workes by way of Word, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the counſel of God, and putting it into execution by his Almighty Word; that is, by the power of his Will outwardly ſet forth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:170109:159"/>
2. <hi>The written Word:</hi> This is nothing elſe but the Writings of Prophets, Apoſtles, and other holy men of God, contained in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament: which, for the excellency of them, are called <hi>The Bible,</hi> or <hi>The Book,</hi> becauſe it's the moſt excellent Book, the Book of Books. This is that Word of God which the Apoſtle here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends unto the Chriſtian Souldier: It is not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Subſtantial word is called; but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is the name given to the written Word.</p>
               <p>I might make many Doctrines, but I will put altogether into this one, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>DOCT.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that would be enabled to withstand, and to overcome Satan in his Temptations, muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to take and uſe the Sword of the Spirit, which is the written Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Sword it was, that our Saviour did both preſerve himſelf, and turned the Devil to flight in his day of Temptation: He drew out this Sword <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> and with the power of it overcame his adverſary, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>In the handling of this Doctrine, I ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen theſe three things:</p>
               <p>(1.) Give ſome Reaſons, to prove, that the Holy Scriptures are the Word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:170109:159"/>
(2.) Shew you the Reaſon of this Title, the Sword of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>(3.) Shew you how this Sword is uſeful to help a Chriſtian in the day of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Scriptures are the Word of God.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>From the evidence of Scripture it ſelf.</hi> For this, I ſhall refer you to theſe places, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. All Scripture is given by inſpiration of <hi>God,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. Prophecie came not in old time by the Will of man, but holy men of <hi>God</hi> ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 119. 105. <hi>Thy Word is a Lamp to my feet:</hi> So <hi>ver.</hi> 72. <hi>The Law of thy mouth is better unto me, then thouſands of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> I might give you thouſands of places to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From the nature of the Writings themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The matter of them is of ſuch height and ſublimity, as that Reaſon is too low to make ſuch diſcoveries.</hi> The myſtery of the Trinity, is a thing above the comprehenſion of Reaſon: Reaſon may a little illuſtrate it, now when 'tis revealed; but Reaſon could never have found it out. The great myſtery of Chriſts Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Perſonal Union of the two Natures: this is a myſtery not onely above Reaſon, but above the Angelical Underſtanding, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:170109:160"/>
The Angels pry into this myſtery: they could never have found it out, had it not been revealed in the Scriptures, <hi>vid. Eph.</hi> 3. 10. This manifold wiſdom of God is made known unto Principalities and Powers by the Church. The Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the Body, is a Doctrine too high for Reaſon to have found out. The Corruption of mans nature by the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The harmonious conſent, and ſweet agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is between one part of Scripture, and another.</hi> Though they were penned by ſeverall perſons, in ſeveral Ages, in ſeveral places farre diſtant, from one another, the Pen-men nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adviſing, nor conferring with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet in nothing contradictory, but ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſponding one with another; one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet writing nothing contrary to another: All the Evangeliſts conſpiring and agreeing mutually one with another, as if they had been all in one and the ſame place: which is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and was never ſeen amongſt the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The rare Predictions which are in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, accompliſhed at the very ſeaſons.</hi> No Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can fore-tell, or fore-know things before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; and the Prophecies of the Scripture are not laid down (Oracle-wiſe) with ambiguity, but with poſitive certainty, expreſſing the very times of things, the names of perſons, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of States, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. It was four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170109:160"/>
years before his birth; and yet when the fulneſs of time came, God ſent forth his Sonne made of a woman, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. So that Prediction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13, 14, Thy Seed ſhall be a ſtranger, &amp;c. This deliverance was fore-told four hundred years before-hand. So that, in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 2, 3. the Prophecy againſt the Altar of <hi>Bethel</hi> in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboams</hi> time, it was, as Chronologers obſerve, 330 and odd years before; and yet 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. 16. it was fulfilled in its ſeaſon. That in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 45. 1. concerning <hi>Cyrus. Cyrus</hi> was not born of a hundred years after that. All the Propheticall Doctrines concerning Chriſt, of his Sufferings, Death, Buriall, his Crucifying with Thieves, Reſurrection; All as punctually fore-told by the Prophets, as related by the Evangeliſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, who were Eye-witneſſes of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The manner of enjoyning the Doctrines therein contained:</hi> Meerly the Authority of the Speaker. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Hear the Word of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Other Writings go about to move men to entertain them by the ſtrength of Naturall Reaſon; ſo did the Philoſophers. It's ſaid of <hi>Plato,</hi> that when he read the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he uſed theſe words: <hi>Hic vir multa di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, nihil probat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Scriptures enjoyn many things which are contrary to reaſon:</hi> That a man ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 2. That when we have done all we can, we are unprofitable ſervants; that a man muſt truſt to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170109:161"/>
of another; that he that will be wiſe, muſt become a fool that he may be wiſe; that he that will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, &amp;c. This makes the Apoſtle ſay, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>That a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man cannot diſcern the things of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The Scriptures doe preſcribe not onely Laws for the outward man, but for the heart alſo.</hi> Thought is free from the cognizance of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Laws, but not from this Law, <hi>Curſe not the King no not in thy thought.</hi> Eccleſ. 10. 20. <hi>How long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Jer. 4. 14. <hi>God ſaw that every imagination of the heart of man was evil,</hi> Gen. 6. 5.

               <p n="7">7. <hi>The heavenlineſs of the Doctrine.</hi> It lifts up men above all earthly things: it calls on men to mortifie their earthly members; to ſet their affections on things above, not on things below, &amp;c.</p>

my Commandements, I will love him, and my Father will love him and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate himſelf to him, &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 23.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>The ſcope and chief aim of it is, to debaſe all Creatures, and to advance and ſet up God alone.</hi> Whether ye eat or drink, &amp;c. do all to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.

               <p>III. <hi>From the rare effects of the Scriptures.</hi> They have a power to terrifie, to comfort, to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to pull down ſtrong Holds, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. To open blind eyes; to convert dead ſoules, &amp;c. <hi>Quale cauſatum, talis cauſa.</hi> Such illuſtrious divine effects, muſt needs have a divine cauſe.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>From the teſtimony and witneſs of the Holy Ghoſt in the hearts of men.</hi> It is the work of the Holy Ghoſt, to ſubdue the heart, to believe, and ſubmit to the Word, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 20. Ye have an unction from that Holy One, &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 14. 26. When the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, is come, he ſhall teach you all things; and whatſoever I have ſaid to you, he ſhall bring to your remembrance. This perſwaſion muſt either be from Sathan, or from a mans own fancy, or elſe from God. It cannot be from Satan; for the Doctrine contained in the Scriptures overthrows him, and his Kingdom, and Deſign. It cannot be from our own fancy; the Doctrine of the Scripture is <hi>ſupra captum noſtrum: ergo.</hi> I could give other Arguments,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170109:162"/>
                  <hi>Ex abſurdo, Ex conſenſu Eccleſiae, Ex Amanuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibus,</hi> &amp;c. but theſe may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Why the Word of God is called, <hi>the Sword of the Spirit.</hi> Conſider four things for this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis from the Spirit Originally.</hi> He is the Compoſer and Framer of this bleſſed Book, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. Holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt. Herein it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from that material Sword: That, is made and faſhioned by man: This, by the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>All the efficacy of it depends upon the Spirit.</hi> He it is that makes it powerfull for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe effects which are done by it upon men. It would be but a woodden ſword, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either edge or point, if the Spirit of God did not give virtue to it. This the Apoſtle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. We ſee it by experience, the ſame word is a dead letter upon ſome, and a convincing and converting word to others: the reaſon is, becauſe the word is ſet on by the Spirit in one, and not in the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>It hath an effectual influence upon the Spirits of men.</hi> It doth not onely reach to the body and outward man, but even to the Spirit and Conſcience alſo. This the Apoſtle teacheth us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. The Word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper then any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170109:162"/>
intents of the heart. Herein it differs from all material Swords. They onely pierce the body, they cannot either wound or defend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but this Sword hath a power, through the Spirit, both to afflict and quiet, to ſettle and unſettle the very Spirit and Soul of man.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The manner of the operation of this Sword is onely Spiritual.</hi> It workes not as the materiall Sword, by bloudy piercings and woundings, but by Spiritual Arguments onely. There is nothing viſible to the eye of the body in the working of this Sword; it doth all for which it is appointed in a ſpiritual way, by ſpirituall Convictions, and Spiritual Comforts, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Reproofs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>III. Wherein this is uſefull to help us againſt Temptations.</p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>The Word of God helps a Christian to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all Satans objections.</hi> Whatſoever ſinne he tempts you to commit; whatſoever Duty he perſwades you to caſt off; whatſoever <hi>medium</hi> he uſeth to preſs his temptation, the Word of God will be able to put full and pertinent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers into your mouthes againſt the ſame. When I opened the 13. verſe, I ſhewed you there were eight evill dayes, in which Satan did violently ſet upon the ſoul.</p>
               <p>The Day of Perſonal outward Affliction.</p>
               <p>The Day of Church-calamity, eſpecially when Hereticks and Seducers are riſen up in the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:170109:163"/>
The Day of ſinful miſcarriage and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The Day of Spiritual Deſertion and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.</p>
               <p>The Day of extraordinary Soul-enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by Divine Manifeſtations, and Incoms from Heaven.</p>
               <p>The Day of Temporal deliverance, and advancement.</p>
               <p>The Day of the ſucceſs of wicked men.</p>
               <p>The Day of Death.</p>
               <p>I ſhewed you what temptations are moſt peculiar to ſuch a day. Now the Word of God will furniſh you with ſufficient Arguments to antidote your Soules againſt the infection of every one of thoſe Temptations. If Satan tempt to pride of heart, the Scripture will arm you againſt that ſinne by ſhewing you the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of Pride. <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble,</hi> Jam. 4. 6. If Satan tempt you to Covetouſneſs, the Scripture will ſhew you the danger of that ſinne: It will tell you that <hi>The love of money is the root of all evil,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 10. And that a mans life conſiſteth not in the abundance of what he enjoyeth, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 15. If Satan tempt you to unrighteouſneſs and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion the Scripture will arm you againſt that ſinne. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. If Satan tempt you to Perjury and Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture will ſhew you the ſad effects
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170109:163"/>
which have followed upon that ſinne. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> for this ſinne, had his eyes put out, and was a Captive all his dayes, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 18. If Satan tempt you to be heretical, or erroneous, the Scripture will ſhew the miſerable fruits of Hereſie: Becauſe they did not receive the truth in the love of it, God gave them up to deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to believe a Lie, that they might all be damned, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11, 12. If Satan tempt you to apoſtatize from the truth for fear of ſuffering, the Scripture will tell you, that if any withdraw, Gods ſoul will have no pleaſure in him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> and he that putteth his hands to the Plough, and looketh back, is not fit for the Kingdome of Heaven <hi>Luke</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> If Satan tempt you to be hypocritical, the Word of <hi>God</hi> will tell you, that Hell is prepared for Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. If Satan tempt you to caſt off Duties, as Prayer, Hearing, the Word of God will tell you the ſad conſequences of ſuch neglect, &amp;c. And our Saviour teacheth us this uſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the day of Temptation, by his own practice, Satan tempts him to work a miracle at his command, by turning ſtones into bread, in the time of hunger, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. He anſwers that temptation, by ſhewing him out of the Scripture, <hi>That man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> ver. 4. Satan tempts him again to caſt him ſelf down from the pinacle, upon a perſwaſion of the protection of <hi>God.</hi> Our Saviour anſwers
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170109:164"/>
that, from the Scripture, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> Satan ſets upon him with a third Argument, to fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him; Our Saviour anſwers that by a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from Scripture, ſhewing him, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Adoration was due to <hi>God</hi> onely, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou ſhalt ſerve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>The Word of God strengthens and teacheth a Chriſtian how to uſe aright all the other parts of the Spiritual Armour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>For the Girdle of Truth;</hi> if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the Doctrine of Truth, the Word helpes you in that: hereby we know, what is Truth, what is Falſhood. Take away the Word <hi>of God,</hi> and there is no ſtandard to meaſure Truth withall: If you underſtand it of the Grace of Truth, Sincerity and Uprightneſs of heart, the Word of <hi>God</hi> is the Preſerver of it. <hi>I was upright before him, and kept my ſelf from mine iniquity, for all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his Statutes from me,</hi> Pſal. 18. 22, 23. The Word of God, as the Sun, exhales all the vapours of hypocriſie out of our hearts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>For the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> The Word of <hi>God</hi> ſtrengthens, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that, if we underſtand it of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our perſons, the Word of <hi>God</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where it lies, and how to put it on, and to uſe it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:170109:164"/>
This righteouſneſs is revealed in the Word. If you underſtand it of the righteouſneſs of our courſe and converſation, the Word of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us for this alſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 9. The Word is the meaſure of righteouſneſs; he hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>For the Shooes of the preparation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi> It is the Word of God that helpes us to take up, and enables us to perſevere in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of going through with the profeſſion of the Goſpel, againſt all difficulties, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, and diſadvantages: the Word whets the edge of theſe reſolutions, when they grow dull and blunt.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>For the Shield of Faith.</hi> The Word is both the Seed which breeds it, and the Nurſe which feeds it, and gives it ſuck. It's called the Word of Faith, not onely becauſe it is the Object of Faith, that which is to be believed; but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Seed of Faith, and the Food of Faith. Faith muſt have a written word to lean upon, elſe it dies.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>For the Helmet of Hope.</hi> The Word of God, to the grace of Hope, is as the light to the eye of the body: it is the Cable of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of Hope: the Word layes the promiſe down, upon which Hope is grounded: the Word ſhewes Gods faithfulneſs, whereby Hope is cheriſhed: the Word is the fewel that keeps it burning. I have hoped in thy Word.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>For Prayer and Supplication.</hi> We can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170109:165"/>
tell what to pray for, nor how to pray aright, without the direction of the Word of God. By the Word of God, we come to know what we want: By the Word of God we come to know what God hath promiſed: The word of God heats the affections to pray with zeal, ſtrengthens the heart to pray in confidence, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables the Spirit to pray with perſeverance. Take away the Fewel of the Word, and the fire of Prayer will be abated, if not quenched.</p>

                  <p>VVEE might elſe have been to ſeek for this Sword, when we ſhould have had occaſion to uſe it. The Church of God for about 2500. yeares wanted this bleſſing. The Doctrine of God was preſerved by the Tradition of a lively voyce, <gap reason="foreign">

Firſt, That by this means it might be kept more pure and incorrupt. We read how much ſoyl the Truth of <hi>God</hi> contracted, by paſſing through the hands of men, while it was by Tradition tranſmitted from Parents to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 2. We read, that even in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Family, there were Idols found; And ſo <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 14. And the Idols of <hi>Egypt</hi> were amongſt the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Though they were Holy, and religious, yet was there much pollution cleaving to the Worſhip of <hi>God</hi> in thoſe dayes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the help of mans weak memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: many of Divine Truths, might, in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time, have ſlipt out of the leaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Veſſel of mans memory, and ſo the Church of <hi>God</hi> ſhould have ſuffered much loſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for the greater ſtability and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Doctrine of Truth againſt all thoſe who ſhould either deny it, or corrupt it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it, <hi>vid. Luk.</hi> 1. 3, 4. By the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>4. For the more facile propagation and ſpreading of the Doctrine of Truth: while it was delivered by Tradition, it was onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170109:166"/>
among the Jewes, and there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that ever it ſhould ſpread any further than their Coaſts: but by the writing of it, it is divulged throughout the world. 'Tis a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be acknowledged! Had not the Word been written, this Sword would have been as a Sword in the Scabbard or Armory; but by the writing of it, it is drawn out of the ſheath, and made of much more uſe to us, in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>That it is an exceeding great mercy that the written Word of God is in our hands.</hi> It might have been written, and yet kept hid from us, as it is yet from the greateſt part of the world, amongſt whom this Light hath never ſhined. This is a priviledge, which is as the Crown of glory upon the people of the Jewes, that to them are committed theſe Oracles of GOD, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 2. By this they were advanced above other Nations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 20. It's our happineſs that we enjoy this Sword. The miſery of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſet out by this, that in the dayes of war, when they had many enemies againſt them, there was neither Sword nor Spear in the hands of any of the people, but in the hands of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> only, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 22. This would have bin our ſad condition, if <hi>God</hi> had not tranſmitted the Bible to our hand. We ſee how often Satan prevails over us now we have the Scriptures; but if we had wanted this Sword, it would have been
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170109:167"/>
altogether impoſſible to have made reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>This is an Apology for the care and dil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the ſervants of God in ſtudying the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Profane men look upon the practice of the godly in this reſpect, as preciſeneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary care. What needs all this, &amp;c. They know the word of <hi>God</hi> is their ſword, they are never ſafe, if this ſword be not girt upon their thighs: They know if either they want this ſword, or be unskilfull in the uſe of it, they muſt needs periſh in the day of battel. VVho blames a ſouldier for wearing his ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him? eſpecially when enemies are purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his life. It is not onely his honour, but his ſafety ſo to do. The ſervants of <hi>God</hi> know that if they leave off this ſpiritual ſword but for a day, they ſhall be ſurely overcome by Satan; and it's better to be reproached by men for wearing it, then to be deſtroyed by Satan by leaving it off. The word of <hi>God</hi> they know is not onely their Sword to defend them in battel, but their Sun to give them light. This Sword hath this advantage of all other Swords, that by it they ſee the lurking places, where the enemy lies hid; and they ſee alſo the refuges where themſelves may be ſecured. It is alſo, that food by which they are revived and ſtrengthned, to hold out in battel. It is their Cordial, as well as their Sword. It is their honey that opens their eyes, when they grow faint with fighting: it puts ſpirits into
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170109:167"/>
their ſpirits, when they are decayed: This Sword teacheth them how to fight. Other Swords onely help the ſouldier how to uſe his skill: they do not give him any skill; but this Sword teacheth skill. It ſhould not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a fault, but a vertue in the ſouldiers of Chriſt, that they are ſo much in the ſtudy of the word of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>No wonder to ſee the Devil ſo victorious, where the word of God is wanting.</hi> VVhat ſtrange abominations do the Gentiles that want the VVord fall into by the temptations of Satan? VVhat Idolatries are there in thoſe places? 'Tis not to be wondred at. They want the Sword of the Spirit, by which they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt temptations; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they want this, they cannot ſtand; they are unarmed men.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>That they are Satans friends, and enemies both to themſelves and others, who lay aſide the Scriptures of God.</hi> There are many in our ſinfull and wanton Age, who deny the authority of the Scriptures, affirming, that they are not from <hi>God:</hi> Others, that ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He believes that the Scriptures are of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 6. It is written, ſaith Satan, that he will give his Angels charge over thee, &amp;c. There is thus much Divinity, and Faith in Hell: the Hiſtory
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170109:168"/>
of the Bible is believed there, though it be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned, and denied on earth. Theſe men are certainly in pay in the Devils ſervice: they diſarm themſelves, and they endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm others. And it's no wonder to ſee them ſo deſperately overcome as they are, running out to profaneneſs in life, to hereſies and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in Opinion. Satan hath not greater Champions in the world then theſe are: they fight againſt God; they fight for Satan, as viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and directly as ever men did. Such alſo, as though they think the Scriptures be of <hi>God,</hi> yet they caſt them aſide, and create another Sword inſtead of this unwritten Revelations, Dreams, and Enthuſiaſms of their own head. God hath made the written VVord to be the Touch-ſtone of all Revelations, <hi>Iſa</hi> 8. 20. To the Law and Teſtimony, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

without the Word, are but the fancies of men. The Devill will not much be afraid of ſuch a Sword as this is, in the day of Temptations: this is not a ſpiritual ſword, but a carnal ſword: this is not the ſword of the Lord, but the ſword of <hi>Saul,</hi> which will never hurt this great <hi>Goliah</hi> in the day of battel. Our Saviour, if ever any, might have truſted to the Sword of Revelation; but ye ſee, he draws out the ſword of the written word, and with that puts Satan to flight, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 4, 6, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>The benefit and neceſſity of the Tranſlations of Scripture.</hi> That the VVord of God ſhould be tranſlated into that language which is known and familiar to every Nation, is not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, but neceſſary. God wrote the Law in that Tongue, which the Jewes, to whom it was given, underſtood: ſo did the Prophets write, and ſo did they preach.</p>
                  <p>The gift of Tongues is given for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: The Apoſtles quoting ſome places of the Old Teſtament, and the New, uſe the very words of the Septuagint, which was a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. God would have all things in the Church to Edification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. This Sword of the Spirit would have been unuſeful to moſt in our Church, and to moſt in all the Churches of Chriſt, had not the VVord been tranſlated. It would have been as a Sword faſtened in the ſheath, or locked up in the Armory, had it not been tranſlated into our own Language; we
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170109:169"/>
ſhould never have known how to have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it, &amp;c. if it had not been tranſmitted to us in a known Tongue. 'Tis true, in all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Religion, we are finally to appeal to the Original Texts, as being immediatly inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>God;</hi> but yet are Tranſlations uſeful, and the very VVord of <hi>God,</hi> by which a Chriſtian may fight as confidently, and as ſucceſsfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan, as if he were able to produce the Original Text. <hi>Gods</hi> goodneſs is to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in giving gifts to men, to draw this Sword for us, and to give it us in our own Tongue.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſubject matter or the things contained in the Scriptures, do appertain to private perſons, as well as to others.</hi> Every man is intereſted in the Doctrine which the word of God teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.

2. <hi>Sometimes he takes men off from the ſtudy of them, by the obſcurity and difficulty of them.</hi> They are perplex &amp; knotty, &amp;c. Thoſe that are moſt able, wreſt them to their own ruine, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. Againſt this deſign we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider four things.</p>
                  <p>1. That although ſome places of Scripture be dark, obſcure, &amp;c. yet thoſe things which are fundamentally neceſſary to ſalvation, are plainly and familiarly laid down, that the meaneſt capacity may underſtand them: As there are great deeps, wherein the <hi>Elephant</hi> may ſwim, ſo are there fords where the Lambe may wade.</p>
                  <p>2. That the obſcurity and difficulty of ſome places, ſhould rather perſwade us to the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſtudy of them. The true ground of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of ſome places in Scripture is, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent nauſeating and loathing of them, by men of large apprehenſions: there's work e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to exerciſe their underſtandings.</p>
                  <p>2. To raiſe our hearts to the admiration of the infinite wiſdom of God, the Authour of them.</p>
                  <p>3. To excite men to be more diligent in the ſtudy of them.</p>
                  <p>III. That, as many wreſt the Scriptures to their own deſtruction: ſo, many are ignorant of them to their own deſtruction. The Lord will come in flaming ſire, to render judgment and vengeance to them that know not God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8. Ye err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</p>

                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:170109:171"/>
4. That obſcurity which is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, doth not ariſe from the nature of that which is affirmed, or from the intention of the perſon affirming; but either from the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or wilfulneſs, of him that wreſts it.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Sometimes he takes men off from the ſtudy of the Scriptures, by ſhewing them the wicked practices of ſuch as are ſo much for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> Are there any ſort of men more looſe, &amp;c? Againſt this deſign, we ſhould conſider theſe things.</p>
                  <p>1. That there are ſome, who by the ſtudying of the Scriptures, are enabled to mortifie ſin, and live holily. Their lives are exemplary, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>2. The looſneſs and ſinfulneſs of ſome, who ſtudy the Scriptures, ariſeth not from the knowledge of the word of <hi>God;</hi> but either from ignorance of it, or want of practiſing it. It is not becauſe they know what they ſhould do, but becauſe they be not careful to do what they know.</p>
                  <p>II. For helps to attain to the exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Scriptures, take theſe.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Be careful every day to read ſome part of them:</hi> Frequent-reading of them will make us exact in them. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> read over the Bible 14. times, with <hi>Lyraes</hi> Poſtils.

Turn over Interpreters, that ye may ſee and finde out the ſence of Scripture, which is indeed the Scripture. <hi>Non in verbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>4. <hi>A good digeſtion of the publique Sermons you hear.</hi> In all Sermons ſome places of Scripture are opened or explained. Theſe would be improved and laid up careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Care to live anſwerable to that meaſure of knowledge you have received, Mat.</hi> 25. 28<hi>: To</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that hath it ſhall be given.</p>

The Apoſtles when they met with any thing they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, they uſed to come to Chriſt for inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 17. Lord teach us this Parable:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170109:172"/>
we would not have you pin your faith on the Miniſters ſleeve, but we would have you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to them for the untying of your knots.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Make uſe of the word of God in the day of battel, as the ſouldier doth of his ſword.</hi> Draw out this ſword, and ſtrike down temptations by the power of it. Arm your ſelves with it, and then uſe it. Many Chriſtians are like ſome men that wear a ſword, but they let it ruſt in the ſcabbard, through cowardice they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to draw it. Many Chriſtians know well how to uſe the ſword of the ſpirit; but when they are aſſaulted, they are ſo aſtoniſhed, that they make no uſe of it. I beſeech you caſt off this ſloathfulneſs, and ſtir up your ſelves; and when you ſee a temptation ariſe, thruſt this ſword preſently into the bowels of it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your ſelves. In the word of God you have theſe five things, that you may make much uſe of in the day of Aſſaults. Precepts, Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Promiſes, Threatnings, Examples: if the temptation be, To take you off from any known duty, urge the Precept: if the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion be to draw you into ſome act of ſin, draw out the Prohibition, and wave it off with it. If Satan ſeek, either by himſelf, or by any of his Inſtruments, to allure you into ſin, by fair promiſes: (this way he ſometimes takes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 37. <hi>they were tempted,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me:)</hi> then do you draw forth the promiſes of God,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170109:172"/>
and ſee what he hath promiſed to obedience. Gods promiſes will not onely ballance, but over-weigh all the Promiſes which Satan and his Inſtruments can make. If Satan and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments threaten, then have recourſe to the threatnings of <hi>God.</hi> And then for the Examples in Scripture, great uſe may be made of them: The example of <hi>Job;</hi> he was aſſaulted, and God reſcued him. <hi>Paul,</hi> he was buffeted, and God delivered him. <hi>Peter,</hi> he was ſurprized, and God reſcued him, &amp;c. If Satan ſhould boaſt of his ſpoyls and victories, as the King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria</hi> did by his General, to King <hi>Hezekiah, Iſa.</hi> 37. 11, 12, 13. If Satan ſhould thus boaſt, the Examples in Scripture will help you to repell theſe boaſtings. Satan, thou couldeſt not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Job,</hi> though God gave thee a full blow at him. Thou couldeſt not overcome <hi>Paul,</hi> though God gave thee leave to buffet him, not once, nor twice but often. Satan cannot deviſe any kind of Temptation, but the Word of God will put a hundred anſwers into your mouthes, to oppoſe it, and beat it back.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have diſpatched the ſixth piece of the <hi>Spiritual Armour, The Sword of the Spirit,</hi> which is, <hi>The Word of God.</hi>

               <p>IN theſe words we have the laſt piece of the ſpirituall Armour, which the Apoſtle recommends unto Chriſtians for their ſafe ſtanding, and certain Victory over Satan and his Temptations, <hi>viz. Prayer and Supplication.</hi> Some Interpreters think, this is no peece of Armour, becauſe there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of any piece of materiall Armour, to which it is reſembled; but I conceive it is a ſpeciall piece of Armour, both offenſive and defenſive, and that the Apoſtle forbears perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to reſemble it to any one piece of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Armour, becauſe no one piece doth

               <p>Though I might make many obſervations of theſe, yet I ſhall onely give you one, which is the main in which I ſhall have occaſion to open all theſe particulars. And it is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that would ſtand in the day of Temptation, and be victorious over Satan, muſt be very careful to make uſe of the duty of Prayer and Supplication unto God.</hi> Or thus, Prayer and Supplication to God, is an excellent and ſpeciall thing to help a Chriſtian to conquer and overcome all the Temptations of Satan, and his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170109:174"/>
This is the way to ſtand, this is the way to overcome.</p>
               <p>In the handling of this Doctrine, I ſhall do theſe three things.</p>
               <p>1. Open briefly the nature of Prayer.</p>
               <p>2. Shew you what are the Ingredients of a conquering Prayer: where I ſhall open thoſe ſix things which I named before.</p>
               <p>3. How this duty of Prayer helps a Chriſtian in this ſpiritual Warre.</p>
               <p>1. What Prayer is. There are two parts of Prayer largely taken. Petition, Thankſgiving. I ſhall not at this time meddle with the latter, but ſpeak onely of petitionary Prayer, which is chiefly meant in this place, of which I lay down this Deſcription.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer is a religious Invocation, or calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true God in the name of Jeſus Christ the Mediator for the obtaining of good things, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for ſoul and body, and averting of evill things, that God may be better glorified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do purpoſely omit many things in this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, which are neceſſary and eſſentiall to Prayer, becauſe they are particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in thoſe Qualifications and Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which will come to be handled in the next particular. I ſhall briefly open this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>'Tis Invocation or calling upon God,</hi> ſo the Scripture uſeth to expreſs it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 9. They
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170109:174"/>
ſhall call on my name, and I will hear them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. How ſhall they call on him, on whom they have not believed? ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. 'Tis called ſometimes the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our requeſt to God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſeeking of Gods face, Speaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, intreating the Lord, &amp;c. All which import invocation. I put this in for theſe two Reaſons, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Becauſe it is in it ſelf an Act of Religion, of ſolemn worſhip and Adoration, ſo much the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth. It is ſometimes uſed for all Religion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26. The reſtoring of the worſhip of God from corruption, wherein it had now for a long time been, is ſet out <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdochically</hi> by that part of it.</p>
               <p>2. To diſtinguiſh it from thoſe Invocations which are not religious, but raſh, paſſionate, inadviſed and prophane wiſhes: ſuch as men in diſcontent and diſtemper put up to God: as alſo to diſtinguiſh it from thoſe Prayers which want thoſe Religious and holy affections and Ingredients which ſhould be in a holy Prayer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 1. 3. 'Tis calling <hi>upon the true God.</hi> This I add for theſe three Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To exclude all prayer made to Saints, Angels, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Prayer being an Act of Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, cannot without manifeſt Idolatry be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to any Creature, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. <hi>Judg.</hi> 13. 16. That in <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16. is not to be

underſtood of a created Angel, but of <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Son of God, the increated Angel of the Covenant, <hi>vid. Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4, 5. compared with <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 28. It was not any created Angel; but God himſelf who redeemed him out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To exclude all prayer to falſe Gods, ſuch as Heathens do invoke, <hi>vid. Pſal.</hi> 44. 21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To teach us that we muſt direct our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God in Trinity. We muſt invocate the Trinity of perſons in the unity of the God-head. When in prayer we name one perſon of the Trinity: we muſt in our heart and minde include the other two; for however, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons be diſtinct in themſelves: yet in all the duties of worſhip which we perform, the name of any perſon, Father, Son, or Holy Ghoſt, is to be taken eſſentially, not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. We are to conceive, the Father ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame God-head, with the Son and Holy Ghoſt, and in all workings, <hi>ad extra,</hi> the three perſons of the Trinity work together, and are only diſtinguiſhed in manner of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Therefore we muſt not ſeparate them in worſhip.</p>
               <p>And when we pray to Chriſt, we are not to ſever his two Natures in our minde; but we muſt call upon him as God and man; for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Manhood is not to be worſhipped with religious worſhip for it ſelf, or by it ſelf, becauſe it is by it ſelfe a Creature: yet as it is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170109:175"/>
perſonally united to the God-head, it is part of that perſon which is true God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be worſhipped with one and the ſame worſhip, wherewith the Godhead is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis <hi>in the name of Chriſt the Mediator.</hi> In the ſtate of innocency man might worſhip <hi>God</hi> without a Mediator, but ſince ſin made the breach, <hi>God</hi> will accept no worſhip from man, but what is tendred in the hands of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. This Mediator is Jeſus Chriſt alone, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. This was typified in the Law. The High Prieſt alone did enter into the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and carry the names of the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> before the Lord, and the people ſtood without, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28. 29. this did typifie Chriſts Mediation. The Mercy ſeat had two things, The Cloud of Incenſe that covered it, The blood of the Bullock ſprinkled before it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 13, 14. That blood typified Chriſts ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Cloud of incenſe, his interceſſion. The Patriarchs of old made all their Prayers in Chriſts name, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 17. Chriſt is the <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder<hi>:</hi> No man comes to the Father but by him. He is our Brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> without whom God will not bid us welcome, <hi>vid. Eph.</hi> 3. 12. This I add for two Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To exclude the mediation of Saints and Angels: the Papiſts make Co-Mediators with Chriſt:</p>
               <p>Secondly, To take off that fond conceit of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170109:176"/>
the meritoriouſneſs of our prayers. Theſe come in the name of your prayers, not in Chriſts name.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>For the obtaining of good things neceſſary for ſoul and body, and the averting of evil things.</hi> Here we have both Petition and Deprecation. That which is to be prayed for compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Good things.</item>
                  <item>2. Things lawful, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14.</item>
                  <item>3. Things neceſſary; not trifles, not vanities; not <hi>res ludicrae:</hi> we muſt not <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Things for ſoul and body, daily bread, pardon of ſinne.</item>
               </list>
               <p>That which is to be prayed againſt, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated: Evill things, Penal Evills, Sinful Evils.</p>
               <p>Only things ſpiritually good muſt be prayed for: In the firſt place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33.</p>
               <p>Abſolutely. All outward things muſt be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and prayed againſt not abſolutely, but with ſubordination to the Will of God, and our good. <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. <hi>That God may be the better glorified.</hi> This I add, to let you ſee what the ſupream and principal end of a Chriſtian ſhould be in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Not ſo much the ſatisfaction of his own wants, or the removal of his own annoyance,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170109:176"/>
as the glorifying of <hi>God, vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be thy name,</hi> is put into the firſt place of that pattern for prayer; and, <hi>Thine is the Kingdome, power and glory,</hi> into the Concluſion, to let us ſee that Gods honour muſt be both the <hi>Alphae</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of our Prayers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what are the Ingredients of a Conquering Prayer?</p>
               <p>In the opening of this, I ſhall give you an Expoſition of that which I made the latter part of the Text, and it hath theſe ſix things in it.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>A conquering Prayer muſt be a frequent Prayer,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. As often as God gives us an occaſion, and fit opportunity, ſo often muſt we perform this Duty of Prayer. Firſt, The Scripture doth not onely enjoyn the Duty of Prayer, but requires frequency in it, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17. Daily prayer is commanded by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> Daily prayer; yea, Morning and Evening prayer, was typified by the morning and evening Sacrifice under the Law, <hi>vid. Exo.</hi> 29. 38, 39. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 3. That was to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> every morning, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evening, without intermiſſion; yea, upon their Sabbaths, and other Feſtivals, though there were other peculiar Sacrifices to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the people, yet the daily Sacrifice was not to be omitted, <hi>Numb.</hi> 28. 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſervants of God have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170109:177"/>
in prayer, <hi>Daniel</hi> uſed to pray three times a day, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>David</hi> ſeven times a day, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 164. Yea, he was <hi>vir orationis,</hi> for his frequency in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. 4. The ſtory relates it of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, that by his frequent prayer, his knees were grown like Camels hoofs for hardneſs.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Satan tempts us frequently: he is every moment ſpreading his Net, and laying his Snare to intrap the Soul: he takes every opportunity to aſſault us: <hi>ergo,</hi> we ſhould take every opportunity to defend our ſelves againſt his Aſſaults, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Your Adverſary goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout continually ſeeking whom to devour.</hi> Himſelf ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 7. That he is continually circuiting, and going up and down to deſtroy. Tis not one Arrow that will ſecure us againſt ſuch frequent and reiterated Temptations. He made three Aſſaults upon our Saviour in a little ſpace of time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>init.</hi> and when he left him, it was but for a ſeaſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>He that would overcome, muſt uſe all kind of prayer.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Prayer is diverſly diſtinguiſhed. In regard of the manner of performing it, it is either, 1. Mental, or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Mental prayer is, when the heart onely prayeth without the voyce: ſuch was that of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 14. 15. Such was that of <hi>Hanna,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 13. Theſe are <hi>mutae preces, &amp; tamen clamantes.</hi> Vocal Prayer is, when the deſires of the heart are drawn out into verbal expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170109:177"/>
ſuch was that of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64. 1.</p>
               <p>2. Either with others, or elſe ſolitary with our ſelves alone: Prayer, with others, is either more publike, as in the Congregation; or more private, as in the Family. Solitary pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is, when the Chriſtian enters into his Cloſet, retires himſelf from all company, and then powres out his deſires to God: ſuch is that our Saviour enjoyns, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. Such was that of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 16. In regard of the matter, Prayer is either for the obtaining of good things; this is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Text: or elſe it is for the diverting of evill, which is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Now all kind of prayer muſt be uſed by him that would overcome Temptations: He muſt pray privately and publikely, mentally and vocally, &amp;c. Every kind of prayer hath in it ſomething which is more peculiarly excellent, which is not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in any other kind of prayer: Publike prayer excels in one kind; private prayer is more excellent in other reſpects, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. 4. Mental prayer, in ſome reſpects, excels vocall in others. In publike prayer there, is more ſtrength, <hi>vis unita fortior.</hi> In private and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayer there is leſs diſtraction. There is in the publike, more Communion with Saints: There is in the private often more Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, leſs interruption, incumbrance, &amp;c. Satan uſeth all kind of Temptations, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170109:178"/>
therefore we ſhould uſe all kind of prayer. The whole vertue of prayer lies not in any one kind, but in all kinds.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>A Conquering Prayer muſt be in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This hath four things in it:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>It muſt be in the Spirit, and not onely in the outward man.</hi> So the Scholiaſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It muſt not be a work of the head, or hands, or eyes onely; but chiefly a work of the heart. Prayer is called the powr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the ſoul, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 15. The powring out of the heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 8. The lifting up, or ſtretching out of the ſoul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 1. We read indeed of the lifting up of the hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28. 2. Of the lifting up of the eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 123. 1. Of the bowing of the knee, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 14. Theſe are fit and convenient poſtures, to manifeſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affections of the heart; but the main work of prayer is in the inward man, <hi>Quod cor non facit, non fit.</hi> Satan is a Spiritual Enemy. Satans Temptations, are Spiritual Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and therefore prayer will do no good againſt him, which is not Spiritual. God will never honour a prayer with victory over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, which is onely a bodily ſervice; yea, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without the heart, drives God away, and brings temptations into the ſoul. It will never be a Satan-conquering, but a ſelf-weakning prayer.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Prayer in the Spirit,</hi> i. e. <hi>Zealous and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, not cold and faint.</hi> So 'tis uſed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170109:178"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. A cold faint prayer will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove a Conquering-prayer. 'Tis fervent prayer, that is the effectuall prayer, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 16. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Such have been the prayers of the victorious ſervants of God. Such was <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 31. compared with <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4. Such was the prayer of <hi>Elias, Jam.</hi> 5. 16. compared with 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 42. We read of ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 30. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24. Labouring fervently <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 12. Praying exceedingly, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 10. Powring out a prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. <hi>tit.</hi> Lifting up a prayer, <hi>Eſa</hi> 64. 7. Stirring up our ſelves in prayer, <hi>Eſa</hi> 64. 7. All which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions note ardency. Satan is not cold, but ſervent; not faint, but zealous in his Aſſaults: he fights againſt us in his Spirit, that is, with all his might; and if we do not pray in the Spirit, we ſhall rather encourage him then get the Victory.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>In the Spirit; that is, in ſincerity.</hi> Spirit is uſed, in Scripture, in oppoſition to hypocriſie, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expounds this, of purity of heart, and integrity. <hi>Hoc est in Spiritu ſemper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rare, mundâ conſcientiâ, &amp; fide integrâ, precem ad Deum dirigere. In carne enim orat, qui pollutâ mente orat.</hi> A prayer proceeding from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure heart, is like rotten Arrows againſt an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, which will neither wound him. nor kill him. Hypocritical prayers ſhall not be heard of <hi>God, Pſal.</hi> 66. 18. Nor ſhall they be fear'd of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170109:179"/>
Satan. Satan is not hypocritical, and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but real and in good earneſt in his temptations; and ſo muſt a Chriſtian be in his prayer, that means to overcome.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>In the Spirit, i. e. By the help of the Holy Spirit.</hi> The Saints have this happineſs, that the Holy Ghoſt makes interceſſion in them with ſighs and groans, which cannot be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. Now he prayes in the Spirit, that prayes by the help and aſſiſtance of the Spirit: he that acteth the Graces of the Spirit in Prayer, Faith, Hope, Heavenlineſs, &amp;c. Some deride Prayer in and by the Spirit. Satan is a Spirit, and no prayer will put him to flight, but that which is framed in the heart by the Holy Spirit of prayer. It is not the gift of Prayer, but the grace of Prayer which gets the day.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>A Conquering Prayer, muſt be a watchfull Prayer.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. This is required as a neceſſary Qualification of Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 41.</p>
               <p>There is a two-fold watchfulneſs, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto prayer.</p>
               <p>1. A watchfulneſs (unto prayer:) Of this we read, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Be ye ſober, and watch unto prayer.</hi> A watchfulneſs (in prayer:) Of which we read, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Watch in prayer with thanksgiving.</hi> He that would overcome Satan by prayer, muſt do both theſe; <hi>He must watch unto prayer;</hi> that is:</p>
               <p>1. He muſt have the thoughts of his heart
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170109:179"/>
taken up about this Duty: he muſt prepare for it, both matters for it, and time for it: he muſt ſo order his affairs, that he may ſolemnly wait upon this work of prayer: many Chriſtians are ſo intangled about other things, they do ſo watch for the matters of this life, that they have no fit time for prayer.</p>
               <p>2. He muſt watch and obſerve thoſe ſpecial ſeaſons, in which God doth move and ſtir up his heart to this Duty. <hi>He muſt watch (in Prayer;)</hi> that is, he muſt watch againſt Drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, againſt Diſtractions, and wandrings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whatſoever may divert him from prayer. It is to be the care of a Chriſtian, that his heart may be compoſed in prayer, that Satan may not take him off from the work he hath in hand.</p>
               <p>Satan watcheth unto Temptation, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth In Temptation; and if we do not watch both Into ſupplication, and In ſupplication, he will have a very great advantage againſt us; your drowſie, careleſs, looſe, unſetled prayer, is the way to encourage, not to diſhearten Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>A conquering Prayer, muſt be a perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Prayer.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It ſignifieth ſuch an invincible conſtancy, and perſeverance, as will be beaten off by no kind of oppoſition, or difficulty whatſoever. This is required in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2. We muſt not onely pray for a day, or a year, and then ceaſe;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170109:180"/>
our prayers muſt continue as long as the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel continues. All victory is promiſed to him onely that perſeveres. Satan is never weary of tempting, and we muſt never be weary of praying. You muſt be ſtill charging and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging this Ordinance of Prayer, as Satan is charging and diſcharging upon you by his Temptations: Diſcontinuing of this, may loſe the battel. The Apoſtle exhorts Chriſtians to have a care that their prayers be not cut off, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The cutting off prayer, is as dangerous as the totall neglecting of prayer.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>A conquering Prayer, must be a charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prayer.</hi> This is, in theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Not, as if we muſt pray for none but Saints. God gives us leave to pray for all ſinners, except thoſe who have ſinned that unpardonable ſinne. <hi>Samuel</hi> prayed for <hi>Saul. Abraham</hi> prayed for <hi>Iſhmael</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of others: His meaning is, we muſt pray for others, eſpecially for the Saints: the Eye of Charity, in this, as in other pieces of it, is to look firſt at the Saints. The Saints are liable moſt of all to the violence of the ſame Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which we are lyable to. The Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing helped by our prayers, will be the better able to pray for us, and to help us in our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, by their prayers. And beſides, Prayers for the Saints, will engage God to hear the prayers that we make for our ſelves, in our
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170109:180"/>
own Temptations. I might add more Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications out of other Scriptures; but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve not to go out of the Text.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Wherein the uſefulneſs of Prayer, as to the overcoming of Satan, and his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, lyeth. This I ſhall ſhew in theſe things, <hi>viz,</hi>

               <p>FIrſt, <hi>Prayer is the way to prevent Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from entring.</hi> It doth make the ſoul, in a manner impenetrable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 41. <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation.</hi> Satans hands are tied up by the power of Prayer ſometimes, that he cannot ſhoot an Arrow of Temptation againſt the Soul. <hi>Lead us not into temptation,</hi> Mat. 6. 13. It's a hard thing for Satan, with all his wiles, to make his fiery Darts faſten upon the Soul of a praying Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Prayer is the way to pull out Satans Darts when they are faſtened:</hi> For, 1. <hi>Prayer ſets the bleſſed Trinity on work for the Souls aſſiſtance.</hi> It engageth God to take our part in the day of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170109:181"/>
battel. When <hi>Moſes</hi> held up his hands, <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed: when he let his hands down, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck</hi> prevailed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee,</hi> Pſal. 50. 15. The Prayer of the Diſciples did awake Jeſus Chriſt, and ſet him awork for them, when the winds and waves did threaten ſhipwrack, and preſent ruine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 24, 25, 26. When the waves and ſtorms of Temptation threaten the ruine of the Soul, Prayer awakes Chriſt, and ſets him on action for the Soules ſafety. The prayer of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was actually engaged with Satan in a very hot Diſpute, brought him in, aſſiſtance from Heaven. <hi>I beſought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me; and he ſaid, My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakneſs,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 12. 8, 9. Prayer brings in ſupply of aſſiſting Grace.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Prayer gives ſtrength to all the other pieces of the Chriſtian Armour.</hi> It is reſerved by the Apoſtle to the laſt place, becauſe both is an evidence we have the other, &amp; becauſe it is ſo helpfull to all the reſt. 1. It doth keep the <hi>Girdle of Truth</hi> upon the Loyns: Holy Prayers are as the Claſps of this Girdle, which tie it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and keep it from falling off. 2. It is that which doth tie together the Breaſt-plate of Righteouſneſs. 3. It keeps on the Shooes of the preparation of the Goſpel upon our feet. Take away the ſtrings of Prayer, and theſe ſhooes will ſoon ſlip off the feet. 4. It ſtrengthens the Shield of Faith, and keeps it from breaking. I
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170109:181"/>
have prayed for thee, that thy Faith do not fail. If either Chriſts prayer for us, or our prayer for our ſelves fail, the Shield of Faith will fail alſo, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. 5. It keeps Hope alive; he that is moſt frequent in prayer, will be moſt lively in hoping. 6. It puts an edge to the Sword of the Spirit: the Word of God ſtirres us up to prayer; and then Prayer makes the Word ſharp and prevalent.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Prayer expels thoſe Corruptions, which wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and prejudice the Soul, and give advantage to Satan in the day of Temptation.</hi> The ſtrength of ſinne, in the ſoul, is the ſtrength of Satan; all his advantage is from our own Corruptions. Now Prayer doth help on the work of Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and Sanctification; it purgeth the Conſcience, it purifieth the heart, it faſtens grace in the root, and increaſeth it in the branch, &amp;c. Every holy Prayer pares off ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from that body of Death, which is Satans Armory, and ſtrong hold in us.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Prayer adds boldneſs and courage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Information. 1. <hi>This lets us ſee the reaſon why Satan is ſuch an enemy to Prayer.</hi> That he uſeth all means to take off the ſervants of God from this Duty, the Scripture tells, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences of all the people of God make it good. What diſtractions and diſturbances doth he ordinarily work in the hearts of men, when they are employed in this ſervice? The Saints of God never find him more buſie with them, then at ſuch a time. When <hi>Paul</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170109:182"/>
to prayer, a Spirit of Divination meets him, and labours to divert his thoughts, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 16. A Child of God can never have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to wraſtle with God in Prayer, but ſome meſſenger of Satan, or other, is ready to wraſtle with him to take him off. This Text ſhews us the reaſon: He knows well, that the ſervants of God are never more ſucceſsfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Temptations; nor that he is never more defeated in his deſigns againſt them, than when they ſet their faces to ſeek God. He hath been ſo often overcome by this Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, that he is afraid of it. Hence it is, that he is ſo diligent, both to take them off from it, and to interrupt them in it. He is moſt afraid of a Child of God, when he is on his knees. This makes him ſo ſtrangely attempt to break off the Exerciſe of it.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>This ſhewes us, that Satan muſt needs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail very much, where Prayer is neglected.</hi> Do not wonder to ſee the Devils Throne erected ſo high in thoſe Families, and in thoſe Perſons, where Prayer and Invocation is caſt aſide. There's nothing in ſuch a ſoul, to hinder ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Reſidence, or Domination. <hi>Watch and pray, ſaith Chriſt, that ye enter not into Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Mat. 26. 41. Thoſe that diſuſe Prayer, muſt neceſſarily be under the power of black Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. They have no defence to keep Satan out; nor have they any way to caſt him out, when he is once entred.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>This lets us ſee the power of Holy Prayer.</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:170109:182"/>
It's a very ſtrong thing: he that conſiders well what prayer hath wrought, cannot imagine it to be a weak thing. It hath for a time ſtopt the courſe of Nature: <hi>Sun ſtand thou still in</hi> Gibeon, <hi>and thou Moon in the Valley of</hi> Ajalon, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 12, 13. <hi>It hath divided the waters of the Sea,</hi> Exod. 14. 21, 22. <hi>It hath quenched the burning flames,</hi> Numb. 11. 1, 2. <hi>It hath caſt Devils out of their poſſeſſion.</hi> The Prayer of <hi>Luther,</hi> and other ſervants of God, recovered a man out of the hands of Satan, who had made an Indenture of his ſoul to him, and ſealed it with his own bloud. The Indenture ſealed, was caſt in, into the place where they were praying. And our Saviour tells, <hi>That no Devil hath ſuch deep poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, but by Prayer and Faſting he may be caſt out,</hi> Matth. 17. 21. In a word, <hi>Prayer hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come God himſelf,</hi> Gen. 32. 26. <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to ſay, There is a kind of Omnipotency in Prayer. It never yet did, it never ſhall, through God, meet with any thing too hard for it. No Journey was ever too long for it: no Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain too high: no Waters too deep: no Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then too heavy: no Temptation too ſtrong. It never was, it never ſhall be, finally and totally overcome by any Adverſary.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>That a Chriſtians Victory over the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Satan doth not depend upon himſelf, but upon God alone.</hi> This is gathered from hence<hi>:</hi> When he hath dreſſed himſelf, and got his weapons into his hands, he muſt then look to his Commander in chief, and conquer by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170109:183"/>
He doth not overcome by fighting, but by praying. All his preparation, all his graces, all his Armour, all his endeavour, will not carry him through the battel with ſucceſs, unleſs God ſtand by him. When he hath done all he can, Prayer muſt be his laſt refuge, that God would vanquiſh his enemies for him.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>This is an Apologie for the people of God, who deſire to be frequent in Prayer.</hi> They have found the benefit of it, and they ſtill know the excellency of it. It's a piece of that Armour which they muſt uſe: nay, 'tis upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, their whole Armour: all the reſt doth no good without it; therefore are they ſo careful to uſe it. They know the danger of Satans Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and they know if they be not frequent and fervent in Prayer, they ſhall be overcome; therefore they willingly neglect no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of performing this ſervice: they know praying Chriſtians, are the ſafeſt Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>That the gift and grace of Prayer, is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous great bleſſing,</hi> That God hath given his Spirit, to be a Spirit of Prayer in us; that God hath given to his people ability to pour out their hearts by prayer, with cries and groanes, that cannot be expreſſed; that Jeſus Chriſt hath given us a Rule how to pray, a pattern for Prayer: This is a ſingular mercy, that you are enabled to make uſe of this Ordinance of Prayer. There are many that know not how to pray after a right manner. If <hi>God</hi> have taught any of you how to pray, you are to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170109:183"/>
it as a marvellous mercy, and to bleſs his name.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>How much you are indebted to them that pray for you.</hi> They ſupply you with Armour.</p>
               <p>Exhortation. Be intreated and perſwaded in <note place="margin">2. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
                  </note> the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to make uſe of this piece of Armour. Pray alwayes with all Prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit, and watch thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with all perſeverance, and ſupplication, for all Saints. In this Exhortation, I ſhall do three things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Give you ſome Motives.</item>
                  <item>2. Help you againſt the Wiles of <hi>Satan,</hi> whereby he endeavours to take you off.</item>
                  <item>3. Give you ſome helps.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I might give you many Motives: I could tell you, that it's the way to have your wants ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: It's the Key of the Treaſury of <hi>Gods</hi> bleſſings: <hi>God</hi> hath appointed this as the great Channel of conveyance of all bleſſings, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5. It's the way to have every thing ſanctified to your uſe: it makes bitter things ſweet, and ſweet things more ſweet: it's that Salt which ſavours every thing, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. It turns all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions into gold, all poyſon into phyſick, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9. It's the way to expell inordinate cares and fears, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. He that is much in prayer, will be little in Care. It's the Nurſe of all graces: it preſerves the fear of <hi>God</hi> in their hearts, <hi>Job</hi> 15. 4. It preſerves the love of <hi>God.</hi> It nouriſheth Humility: it keeps the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience clean and tender; it preſerves and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170109:184"/>
maintains heavenly-mindedneſs, &amp;c. But I ſhall onely urge that which is in the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It's the way to have certain victory over all Temptations.</hi> Satan may ſhatter a praying Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, but he ſhall never conquer him: He may, for a time, bring him into his Net; but <hi>God</hi> will reſcue him, and bring him out again. Whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I call upon God, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> then ſhall mine enemies be put to flight, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56. 9. Prayer, rightly managed, wil carry you through an Hoſt of Temptations. Theſe black Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will and muſt give way to the power of prayer, if you continue inſtant in it. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get victory over the leaſt Temptation without prayer; and the greateſt Temptation ſhall be ſubdued, if you continue in this Duty. Satan is as well able to overcome God, as to overcome prayer, which hath the ſtrength of God in it.</p>
               <p>2. To help you againſt the wiles of Satan: He hath many Devices to take off the Children of God from prayer, <hi>viz,</hi> theſe ſix things.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>God knows what I want, though I do not pray.</hi> I cannot, by prayer, move God to beſtow any thing which he hath not intended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> What need is there of prayer? Againſt this wile of Satan, conſider theſe three things.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>The receiving of the good things we want, is not the onely end of Prayer.</hi> It is one great end, but there are many other things beſides, which ſhould move us to this Duty. We are to pray,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170109:184"/>
1. In obedience to the Command of God. It is a piece of Divine Worſhip and Adoration: it is a part of that homage which all the ſons of men owe unto God.</p>
               <p>II. That thou mayſt enjoy Communion and Fellowſhip with God, by the uſe of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Prayer.</p>
               <p>III. To acknowledge thy ſubmiſſion to <hi>God,</hi> and thy dependance upon <hi>God:</hi> Not to pray, is to caſt off that Dominion which <hi>God</hi> hath over thee: it is to deny thy reliance upon <hi>God.</hi> 'Tis to ſay, thy dependance is not upon <hi>God,</hi> but upon thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Thou canſt have no ground to believe, that any good thing ſhall be beſtowed upon thee without Prayer.</hi> Prayer, though it be not the cauſe, yet it is the condition, or the mean, of obtaining all that good which God hath promiſed unto his people <hi>vid. Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. <hi>I will yet for all this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi> No man can ſay, I ſhall have this mercy, though I do not pray.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>'Tis not the bare enjoying of the good we want which ſhould ſatisfie us.</hi> We ſhould alſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to enjoy it in mercy, to enjoy it as a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Now 'tis an everlaſting, and moſt certain Truth, that whatſoever is not obtained by prayer, is not given in mercy, <hi>vid.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. A man hath not a ſanctified right to any thing he poſſeſſeth without prayer.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Satan ſometimes labours to take off men from Prayer, by objecting their infirmities and</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:170109:185"/>
                  <hi>weakneſſes.</hi> Thy heart is thus and thus diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, &amp;c. Againſt this, I would give you theſe two Anſwers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis not the infirmities and weakneſſes of a Chriſtian which are ſeen and lamented, that can hinder the efficacy and ſucceſs of his Prayers.</hi> Sin obſtinately and avowedly continued in, will indeed cut off the ſucceſs of Prayers, and make both them, and him that makes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 9. But infirmities which are continually reſiſted and bewailed ſhall never make the prayer to be rejected. I might give you many inſtances; as that of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> A man full paſſions, &amp;c. Yet Chap. 2. 10. God heard his Prayer. King <hi>Aſa,</hi> a man full of infirmities, impriſons the Seer, oppreſſeth the people, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 10. yet God heard his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Chap. 14. 11, 12. But I ſhall give onely that one remarkable inſtance, which is recorded as a help againſt this Rock, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Elias</hi> was a man of like paſſions, as we are, &amp;c. Yet was heard very graciouſly: Heaven was opened, and ſhut at his prayers. Gods hearing of our prayers, doth not depend upon our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but upon our Juſtification. He doth not hear our prayers, becauſe either we, or our prayers, are perfect; but becauſe our perſons are accepted. God doth not hear our prayers, for our prayers ſake, but for his own names ſake, and for his ſons ſake, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This ſhould rather encourage us to the Duty.</hi> Diſcontinuance of prayer, will not remove,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170109:185"/>
but increaſe our imperfections: if grace be weak, the omiſſion of prayer will make it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: if Corruption be ſtrong, diſuſe of prayer will make it ſtronger. The diſtempers of the heart, whatſoever they are, will not be abated, but augmented, by the omiſsion of this Duty of prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Satan will perſwade men, perhaps, that they are not in a ſtate of Grace.</hi> 'Tis true, if they had but onely infirmities, they might be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to pray, &amp;c. but they are unregenerate perſons, &amp;c. Againſt this, I would give theſe Anſwers. Beſides this, in the general, that it is a good ſign there is ſomething of grace, when Satan perſwades men to the contrary, &amp;c. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That Prayer is a work fit for ſuch as are not converted, as well as ſuch as are converted.</hi> 'Tis the Duty of men to pray, as they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, who owe homage to God.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Prayer is to be made for Converſion, as well as after Converſion.</hi> A man is not to pray onely becauſe he is forgiven; but alſo, he is to pray that he may be forgiven: ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 22. <hi>Repent, ſaith</hi> Peter, <hi>to</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>of this thy wickedneſs, and pray God, if (perhaps) the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Thoſe who never pray, they proſper in the world, as well as ſuch who are moſt carefull of this Duty.</hi> This is another of Satans Devices. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, conſider theſe things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:170109:186"/>
1. <hi>Outward proſperity is not the only reaſon why men ſhould pray.</hi> Yea, this, is one of all the meaneſt ends of prayer.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>All proſperity, which is not the effect of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is indeed a Curſe, and not a bleſsing.</hi> Nothing is ſanctified, as I ſaid before, but that which comes in by prayer. If his Children be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, it is for the ſword, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 14. If his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble be richly furniſhed, it is to enſuare him: his Wealth is his Trap, &amp;c. Whatſoever a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes, without prayer, is, in Gods Account, no better then Robbery.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>God hath an eternity of adverſity, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, after this life.</hi> They have received their Conſolations in this life, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 24.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Satan takes off others, by objecting their Diſabilities.</hi> Thou wants thoſe gifts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, which others have: <hi>Ergo.</hi> Againſt this, I would ſay theſe things:</p>
               <p>1. <hi>God doth not ſo much look at the gift of Prayer, as at the Spirit of Prayer.</hi> Though it be the Duty of every perſon to labour for fit words of Prayer; yet God doth not hear pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the elegancy of phraſe, but for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs, and ſpiritualneſs, and brokenneſſe of heart of him that prayes. The publicans prayer had not much eloquence in it, <hi>God be mercifull to me a ſinner;</hi> and yet God accepted it. The Spirit of God helps our infirmities, ſaith the Apoſtle, with ſighs and groans, &amp;c. One ſigh and groan from a broken heart, is better pleaſing to <hi>God,</hi> then all humane eloquence, if the heart
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170109:186"/>
be not affected.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Pray that thou mayſt have better gifts.</hi> God hath promiſed his Holy Spirit to them that ask, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 13.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Thou doſt not pray to God as a critical ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of incongruous expreſſions; but to God, as a Father;</hi> Who is wel pleaſed with the prayers of his Children, becauſe they are his children.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Satan perhaps, will endeavour to take off Prayer, from thy long-waiting for an Anſwer.</hi> Thou haſt prayed many a time, but received no anſwer, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi> I would againſt this Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem, give theſe things, by way of anſwer.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>God hath more wayes of anſwering prayers then one.</hi> There are three remarkable inſtances in Scripture of this, <hi>vid. Acts</hi> 1. 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. The particular thing was not granted, and yet his prayer was heard.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Delayes are not denyals.</hi> God defers to hear, not becauſe he doth not love us, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in us, but for other ends. As,</p>
               <p>To exerciſe of Faith, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>To exerciſe our Patience.</p>
               <p>To ſtir up our zeal and importunity in asking.</p>
               <p>To give us what we ask in a fitter ſeaſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>That is a very ſtrange expreſsion which we have in <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 5, 6. Jeſus loved <hi>Martha,</hi> and her ſiſter, and <hi>Lazarus:</hi> and ſee what followes, <hi>v.</hi> 6. When he heard therefore that he was ſick, he abode two dayes ſtill in the ſame place
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170109:187"/>
where he was: A very ſtrange effect of love; A plain contradiction, if Reaſon might be Judge. Deferring to hear prayers, is not alwayes an evidence of hatred, but ſometimes an evidence of love, <hi>Calv. in locum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Let this rather be a Motive to confirme, then a diſcouragement to take thee off from prayer.</hi> God will hear at laſt, that's certain: and, do not loſe ten or twenty years waiting, for want of a little patience.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Though God ſhould never hear, yet it were thy duty to pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. To lay down ſome helps for prayer: theſe things will be of very great uſe to this purpoſe, to teach us to pray, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Be well acquainted with the Doctrine of the Bible, that you may thereby get the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of the good which <hi>God</hi> hath therein promiſed unto his people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Get a through and perfect ſenſe of your own wants:</hi> Senſe of want, will make the dumb Child to beg.</p>
